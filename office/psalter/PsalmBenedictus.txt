1 (Song of Zechariah: Luke 1:68-79)
2 Blessed be the Lord [cross] God of Israel; because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people;
3 And hath raised up a horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant:
4 As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from the beginning:
5 Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us:
6 To perform mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy testament,
7 The oath which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us,
8 That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear,
9 In holiness and justice before him all our days.
