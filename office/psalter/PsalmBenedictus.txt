(Song of Zechariah)
Blessed be the Lord [cross] God of Israel; because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people;
And hath raised up a horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant:
As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from the beginning:
Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us:
To perform mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy testament,
The oath which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us,
That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear,
In holiness and justice before him all our days.
