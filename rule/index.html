					For the needs of the faithful, that the prayers of all those who call upon Thee in trouble may be hastened, that all may rejoice in their necessities Thy mercy has given them, and that Thou would cleanse the world of all errors, to take away disease, drive away famine, open prisons, break chains, and grant safe return to travelers and health to the sick:<br/>

				<h2>Collect for Grace</h2>
				<p>
					Again and often we fall down before Thee and beg of Thee that Thou would cleanse our souls and bodies from all pollution of sin, and that Thou would vouchsafe for us to stand blameless and uncondemned before Thee on the last day.  Grant, O God, unto us and those we pray for an increase of faith, of life, and of knowledge of Thee, and vouchsafe unto us, ever with fear and love, to serve Thee perfectly, and to be made worthy of Thy heavenly kingdom.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us pray:<br/>
					O Lord our God, we have erred and strated from Thy ways. We have followed the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against Thy holy laws. But Thou, O Lord, desires not the death of a sinner, but his life. A contrite and sorrowful heart Thou will never despise. Informed by the teaching of Thy divine Son, we are bold to say:
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="verse">V.</span> Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br/>
					<span class="verse">R.</span> Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil.
				</p>
				<p>
					I confess to almighty God, to blessed Mary ever-Virgin, to blessed Michael the Archangel, to blessed John the Baptist, to the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, to all the Saints, and to you, brothers: I have greatly sinned in thought, word, and deed: through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore I beg of blessed Mary ever-Virgin, blessed Michael the Archangel, blessed John the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, all the Saints, and you, brothers, to pray for me to the Lord our God.
				</p>
				<p>May the almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. And may the almighty and merciful Lord grant us every pardon, absolution, and remission of all our sins.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="verse">V.</span> Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God:<br/>
					<span class="verse">R.</span> Have mercy on me, a sinner.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Symbol of Faith</h2>
				<p>
					I believe in one God: the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-Begotten Son of God. Born of the Father before all ages. God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God. Begotten, not made, of one substance with the Father: by whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven. <span class="verse">(kneel)</span> And was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary: and was made man. <span class="verse">(arise)</span> He was crucified also for us: under Pontius Pilate he suffered, and was buried. And he was resurrected on the third day, as according to the Scriptures. And he ascended into heaven: he is seated at the right hand of the Father. And he will come again with glory to judge the living and the dead: whose kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life: who proceeds from the Father and the Son. Who with the Father and Son together is adored and co-glorified: who spoke by the Prophets. As by the one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. And I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.

				<h2>Collect for Communion</h2>
				<p>
					Let us pray:<br/>
					Lord Jesus Christ, our God, from Thy holy dwelling, from the throne of the glory of Thy kingdom, come to sanctify us, Thou who sits above with the Father, and make us worthy to partake of Thy immaculate Body and Thy precious Blood. We believe, O Lord, and confess that Thou are the true Christ, the Son of the living God who came into the world to save sinners. We believe that Thy Body and Blood, offered up and shed for us upon Thy Cross, is made present again in the Most Holy Sacrament.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember me this day, O Lord, not like a traitor as Judas with his kiss, but like the thief who confessed unto Thee. Let me not be separated from Thee, and on my last day welcome me into Thy kingdom.
				</p>
				<p>
					O Christ, great and priestly Paschal Lamb, Wisdom, Word, and power of God: grant that we may come to have a more intimate communion with Thee in the day of Thy kingdom that knows no night. Amen.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					We kneel before Thy Cross, O Christ, and we praise and glorify Thy holy Resurrection. For Thou are our God and besides Thee we know no other, and we call upon Thy Name. Come, all ye faithful, let us worship the Resurrection of Christ, and behold: through the Cross joy has come to the whole world. At all times blessing the Lord, we praise His Resurrection, for having endured the Cross for us, He has overcome death by death. Shine out, new Jerusalem, for the glory of the Lord is spread abroad over thee: rejoice and be glad.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us pray:<br/>
					<span id="concluding_collect"></span> For Thine is the strength and Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory: now and for all ages of ages. Amen.
