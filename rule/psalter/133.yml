verses:
  - text: |
      Behold: how good and how pleasant
        is the dwelling of brothers together.
  - text: |
      Like good oil on the head
        coming down over the beard,
      Aaron's beard that comes down
        over the opening of his robe.
  - text: |
      Like Hermon's dew that comes down
        on the parched mountains.
  - text: |
      For there the Lord ordained the blessed:
        life forevermore.
