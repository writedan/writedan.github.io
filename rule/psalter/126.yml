verses:
  - text: |
      When the Lord restores Zion's fortunes,
        we should be like dreamers.
  - text: |
      Then will our mouth fill with laughter
        and our tongue with glad song.
        Then will they say in the nations:
        "Great things has the Lord done with these."
  - text: |
      Great things has the Lord done with us:
        we shall rejoice.
  - text: |
      Restore, O Lord, our fortunes
        like freshets in the Negeb.
  - text: |
      They who sow in tears
        in glad song will reap.
  - text: |
      Though he walks along and weeps,
        the bearer of the seed bag.
        He will surely come in with glad song
        bearing his sheaves.
