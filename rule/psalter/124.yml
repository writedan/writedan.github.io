      were it not the Lord Who was for us
        when people rose against us

      Then the waters would have swept us up,
        the torrent come up past our necks.

        Who did not make us prey for their teeth.

      Our life is like a bird escaped
        from the snare of the fowlers.
        The snare was broken
        and we escaped.

        Maker of heaven and earth.
