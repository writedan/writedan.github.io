    text: |
      To Thee I lift up my eyes,
        O dweller in the heavens.

      Behold: like the eyes of slaves to their masters,
        like the eyes of a slavegirl to her mistress,
      so are our eyes to the Lord our God
        until He grants us grace.
  - text: |
      Grant us grace, Lord, grant us grace:
        for we are sorely sated with scorn.
  - text: |
      Sorely has our being been sated
        with the contempt of the smug,
      the scorn of the haughty.
