verses:
  - text: |
      If the Lord does not build a house,
        in vain do its builders labor on it.
      If the Lord does not watch over a town,
        in vain does the watchman look out.
  -  text: |
      In vain are thou who rise early, sit late,
        eaters of misery's bread.
        So much He gives to His loved one in sleep.
  - text: |
      Behold: the estate of the Lord is sons,
        reward is the fruit of the womb.
  - text: |
      Like arrows in the warrior's hand,
        thus are sons born in youth.
  - text: |
      Happy is the man
        who fills his quiver with them.
        They shall not be shamed
        when the speak with their enemies at the gate.
