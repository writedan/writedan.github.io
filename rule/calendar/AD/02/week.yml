      And it shall happen on that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob shall no longer lean on him who strikes them but shall lean on the Lord, Israel's Savior, in truth. A ramnant shall come back, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

      Thus said the King, Lord of Armies: "Do not be afraid, My people dwelling in Zion, of Assyria, who strikes thee with the rod, and raises his club against thee in the way he did to Egypt.
      
      It shall happen on that day:
      his burden shall be removed from thy shoulder
        and his yoke shall be shattered from thy neck."

      It is close to her time now:
        her days shall not draw on.
        
      For the Lord shall have pity of Jacob and again shall choose Israel and set them down on their land, and the sojourner shall join them and become part of the house of Jacob.
