      verse: Isaiah 27:1-13
      text: |
        On that day the Lord shall punish
          with His fierce and great and mighty sword
        Leviathan the slippery serpent,
          Leviathan, the twisting serpent,
            and shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.
        On that day:
          "A lovely vineyard, sing out to it.
        I, the Lord, watch over it,
          moment by moment I watch it,
        so that no harm comes to it,
          night and day I watch over it.
        No anger do I have,
          should one give Me thorns and thistles,
        I would stride out in battle agaisnt it.
          I would set it on fire.
        If he clings to My stronghold,
          he makes peace with Me
            he makes peace with Me.
            
        In days to come Jacob shall take root,
          Israel shall bud and flower,
            and the face of the world shall fill with bounty.
        
        Has he been struck like the blow of his striker?
          Like the slaying of his slain was he slain?
        In due measure, when He drove her out, He contended with her,
          He let loose His fierce blast on an east-wind day.
        Therefore in this shall Jacob's crime be atoned,
          all this comes from removing his offense:
        when he turns all the stones of the altar
          into shattered stones of chalk:
            no cultic poles or incense altars shall stand.
            
        For the fortified town is solitary,
          an abode deserted and abandoned, like the desert.
        There the calf grazes
          and there it lies down and gnaws away its boughs.
        When its branches are dry, they are broken.
          Women come, light fires with them,
            for they are not a discerning people.
        Therefore its Maker shall show it no mercy,
          and its Fashioner shall not grant it peace.
        
          And it shall be on that day:
        the Lord shall beat out the grain
          from the stream of te Euphrates to Egypt's river.
        And thou shall be gathered in
          one by one, thou Israelites.
        And it shall be on that day
          a great ram's horn shall sound
        and those lost in the land of Assyria shall come,
          and the dispersed in the land of Egypt
        and bow down to the Lord
          on the holy mountain, in Jerusalem.

      verse: Matthew 11:16-19
      text: >
        Jesus spoke unto the crowds: "But to what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another: 'We played the flute for thee, and thou did not dance: we wailed and thou did not mourn.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they said: 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinknig, and they said: 'Behold: a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds."

      verse: |
        Against Heresies
        Book V, Chapters I and XIX; XX; XXI, C. I
        Saint Irenaeus, Doctor and Bishop
      text: >
        The Lord, coming into His own creation in visible form, was sustained by His own creation which He Himself sustains in being. His obedience on the tree of the Cross reversed the disobedience at the tree in Eden: the good news of the Truth announced by an Angel to Mary, a virgin subject to a husband, undid the evil lie that seduced Eve, a virgin espoused to a husband. As Eve was seduced by the word of an Angel and so fled from God after disobeying His word, Mary in her turn was given the good news by the word of an Angel, and bore God in obedience to His word. As Eve was seduced into disobedience to God, so Mary was persuaded into obedience to God: thus the Virgin Mary became the advocate of the virgin Eve.
        
        Christ gathered all things into one, by gathering them into Himself. He declared war against out enemy, crushed him who at hte beginning had taken us captive in Adam, and trampled on his head, in accordance with God's words to the serpent in Genesis: "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall lie in wait for thy head, and thou shall lie in wait for his heel." The one lying in wait for the serpent's head is the One Who was born in the likeness of Adam from the woman, the Virgin. This is the seed spoken of by Paul in the letter to the Galatians: "The law of works was in force until the seed should come to whom the promise was made." He shows this even more clearly in the same letter when he says: "When the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son, born of a woman." The enemy would not have been defeated fairly if his Vanquisher had not been born of a woman, because it was through a woman that he had gained mastery over man in the beginning, and set
        himself up as man's adversary.
        
        That is why the Lord proclaims Himself to be the Son of Man, the one who renews in Himself that first man from whom the race born of woman was formed: as by a man's defeat our race fell into the bondage of death, so by a man's victory we were to rise again to life.

        God will send out His Angels with a loud trumpet call: and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

      verse: Revelation 15:3-4
      text: |
        Great and amazing are Thy deeds,
          Lord God the Almighty.
        Just and true are Thy ways,
          King of the nations.
        Lord, who will not fear
          and glorify Thy Name?
        For Thou alone are holy.
          All nations will come
            and worship before Thee,
        for Thy judgments have been revealed.

      verse: 2 Peter 3:8-9
      text: >
        Do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some think of slowness, but is patient with thee, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance.
