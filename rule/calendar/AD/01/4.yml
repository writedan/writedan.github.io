      verse: Isaiah 25:6-9
      text: |
        And the Lord shall prepare a banquet for all the peoples on this mountain, a banquet of rich food, a banquet of well-aged wins, rich food with marrow, well-aged wines fine strained. And He shall swallow up on this mountain the veil that covers all the peoples and the mantle cast over all the nations. He shall swallow up death foreer, and the King the Lord shall wipe tears from every face, and His people's disgrace He shall take off from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken. And it shall be said on that day:
        
        "Behold: this is our God
          in Whom we hoped, and He rescued us.
        This is our own God in Whom we hoped:
          let us exult and rejoice in His rescue."

        Jesus spoke unto His disciples: "Be on guard so that thy hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day does not catch thee unexpectedly like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the earth. Be alert at all times, praying that thou may have the strength to escape all these things what will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."

      verse: Isaiah 7:14-15, 9:5-6
      text: >
        Therefore the King Himself shall give thee a sign: the virgin is about to conceive and bear a Son, and she shall call His Name Immanuel. Curds and honey He shall eat until He knows how to reject evil and choose good.
        
        For a Child has been born to us,
          a Son has been given to us,
            and leadership is on His shoulders.
        And His Name is called Wondrous Councillor,
          Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace
        making leadership abound and peace without end
          on the throne of David and over his kingdom
        to make it firm-founded and stay it up
          in justice and righteousness forever more.
        The zeal of the Lord of Armies shall do this.

        Do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, Who will bring light to things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.
