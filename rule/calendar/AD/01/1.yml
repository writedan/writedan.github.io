      text: |
        Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth:
          for the Lord has spoken.
        "Sons I have nurtured and raised
          but they rebelled against Me.
        The ox knows its owner
          and the donkey its master's stall.
        Israel did not know,
          My people did not pay heed."
        Woe! offending nation,
          people weighed down with crime,
        seed of evildoers,
          sons acting ruinously.
        They have forsaken the Lord,
          scorned Israel's Savior,
            they have fallen behind.
        Why would thou be beaten more,
          still swerving from the way?
        Every head is sick
          and every heart in pain.
        From footsole to head
          no place in him intact,
        wound, bruise,
          and open sore:
        not drained, not bandaged,
          nor soothed with oil.
        Thy land is desolate:
          thy towns are burned in fire.
        Thy soil, before thy eyes:
          strangers devour it,
            and desolation like an upheavel: wasted by strangers.
        And the daughter of Zion remains
          like a hut in the vineyard,
        like a shed in a patch of greens,
          like a town besieged.
        Had not the Lord of Armies
          left a scant remnant,
        we would be like Sodom:
          we would resemble Gomorrah.
          
        Listem to the word of the Lord,
          O leaders of Sodom,
        give ear to God's teaching,
          O people of Gomorrah.
        "Why need I all thy sacrifices?"
          says the Lord.
        "I am sated with the burnt offerings of rams
          and the suet of fatted beasts,
        and the blood of bulls and sheep and goats
          I do not desire.
        When thou comes to see My face,
          who asked this of thee,
            to trample My courts?
        Thou shall no longer bring false gain offering:
          it is an incense of abomination to Me.
        New moon and sabbath and assemblies:
          I cannot bear thy crime and convocation.
        Thy new moons and thy appointed times
          I utterly despise.
        They have become a burden to Me,
          I cannot bear them.
        And when thou spreads thy palms,
          I avert My eyes from thee.
        Thou thou abundantly prays,
          I do not listen:
            thy hands are full of blood.
        Wash, become pure,
          remove thy evil acts from My eyes,
            cease doing evil.
        Learn to do good,
          seek justice.
        Make the oppressed happy,
          defend the orphan,
            argue the widow's case."
            
        "Come, pray, let us come to terms,"
          the Lord said.
        "If thy offenses be like scarlet,
          like snow shall they turn white.
        If they be red as dyed cloth,
          they shall become like pure wool."

      verse: Matthew 24:37-44
      text: >
        Jesus spoke unto His disciples: "For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the Flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah enter the ark, and they knew nothing until the Flood came and swept them all away. So too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in a field: one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding meal together: one will be taken and one will be left. Keep awake therefore: for thou does not know on what day thy Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore thou also must be ready: for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.

        Catechetical Lecture XV
        Excerpts from Chapters I, II, and III
        Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, Doctor and Bishop
      text: >
        We do not preach only one coming of Christ, but a second as well, much more glorious than the first. The first coming was marked by patience: the second will bring the crown of a divine kingdom. In general, whatever relates to our Lord Jesus Christ has two aspects. There is a birth from God before the ages, and a birth from a virgin at the fullness of time. There is a hidden coming, like that of rain on a fleece, and a coming before all eyes, still in the future. At the first coming, He was wrapped in swaddling clothes in a manger. At His second coming, He will be clothed in light as in a garment. In the first coming, He endured the Cross, despising the shame: in the second coming, He will be in glory, escorted by an army of Angels.
        
        We look then beyond the first coming and await the second. At the first coming we said: "Blessed is He Who comes in the Name of the Lord." At the second we shall say it again: we shall go out with the Angels to meet the Lord and cry out in adoraiton: "Blessed is He Who has come in the Name of the Lord."
        
        The Savior will not come to be judged again, but to judge those by whom He was judged. At His own judgment, He was silent: then He will address those who committed the outrages against Him when they crucified Him and will remind them: "Thou did these things, and I was silent." His first coming was to fulfil His plan of love, to teach men by gentle persuasion. This time, whether men desire it or not, they will be subjects of His kingdom by necessity.
        
        Malachi the Prophet speaks of the two coming: "And the Lord Whom thou seeks will come suddenly to His temple": that is one coming. Again he says of another coming: "Behold: the Lord almighty will come, and who will endure the day of His entry? Who will stand in His sight? He comes like a refiner's fire, a fuller's herb: and He will sit refining and cleansing." These two comings are also referred by Paul in writing unto Titus: "The grace of God the Savior has appeared to all men, instructing us to put aside impiety and wordly desires and live temperately, uprightly, and religiously in this present age, waiting for the joyful hope, the appearence of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ." Notice how he speaks of a first coming, for which he gives thanks, and a second, which we still await.
        
        That is why the faith we profess has been handed on to thee in these words: "He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father, and He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and His kingdom will have no end." Our Lord Jesus Christ will therefore come from heaven. He will come at the end of the world, in glory, at the last day. For there will be an end to this world, and all creation will be made new.

      verse: Romans 13:11-12
      text: >
        Thou knows what time it is, how it is now the moment for thee to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers: the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.

        Alleluia!
        Salvation and glory and power to our God:
          for His judgments are true and just:
        Praise our God,
          all ye His servants,
        all who fear Him,
          small and great.

        for the marriage of the Lamb has come,
          and His bride has made herself ready.

        Sermon XVIII on the December Fast
        Saint Leo the Great, Doctor and Pope
      text: >
        Our Savior Himself instructed His disciples concerning the times and seasons of the coming of the kingdom of God and the end of the world, and He has given the same teaching to the Church by the mouth of His apostles. In connection with this subject then, Our Lord bids us beware, lest we let our hearts grow heavy through excess of meat and drink and wordly thoughts. Dearly beloved brethren, we know how that this warning applies particularly to us. We know that day is coming, and though for a season we know not the very hour, yet this we know: that it is near.
        
        Let every man then make himself ready against the coming of the Lord, so that He may not find him making his belly his god, or the world his chief care. Dearly beloved brethren, it is a matter of every day experience that fullness of drink dulls the keenness of the mind, and that excess of eating unnerves the strength of the will. The very stomach protests that gluttony does harm to bodily health, unleess temperance get the better of desire, and the thought of the indigestion afterward check the indulgence of the moment.
        
        The body without the soul has no desires: its sensibility comes from the same source as its movements. And it is the duty of a man with a reasonable soul to deny something to his lower nature and keep back the outer man from things unseemly. Then will his soul, free from fleshly cravings, sit often at leisure in the palace of the mind, dwelling on the wisdom of God. There, when the roar and rattle of earthly cares are stilled, will she feed on holy thughts and entertain herself with the expectation of everlasting joy.
