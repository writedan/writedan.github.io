ADVENT      01  Put forth Thy power, O Christ, and come, that with Thee as our Protector we may be rescued from the dangers of our sins and be saved by Thy deliverance./1
                May we receive Thy mercy, O Lord, that we may, with becoming honor, prepare for the approaching solemnities of our redemption./2
            02  Stir up our hearts, O Lord, to prepare the ways of Thy only-Begotten Son, so that through His coming we may be able to serve Thee with purified minds./2
                We who have been refreshed by the food of spiritual nourishment humbly beseech Thee, O Lord, that through partaking of the Eucharistic Sacrament Thou will teach us to disdain the things of earth and love those of heaven./2

                We entreat Thee, merciful Lord, that Thy divine helps may cleanse us from our sins and prepare us for the coming festal season./2
            04  Put forth Thy power, O Christ we beseech Thee, and delay not: and with Thy great power come to our aid, so that what is hindered by ours sins may be hastened by Thy merciful goodness./1
                Having received Thy grace, we beseech Thee O Lord, that each partaking of the Eucharistic Sacrament may increase within us its saving effect./2

ANTIPHON:
advent      This is the good news the Prophets foretold: the Savior will be born of the Virgin Mary.
            The nations will revere Thy Name, O Lord.
            And the great ones of the earth will acknowledge Thy glory.
            The Angel Gabriel said to Mary in greeting: "Hail full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed are thou among women."
            Remember us, Lord, because of the love Thou has for Thy people.
            Come and bring us Thy salvation.
            Mary said: "My soul is deeply troubled: what can this greeting mean? Am I to give birth to my King and yet remain a virgin forever?"
            Come, Lord, do not delay.
            Free Thy people from their sinfulness.
