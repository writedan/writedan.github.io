    verse: Acts 2:32-36
    text: >
      Being exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, Christ has poured out this that ye both see and hear. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says: "The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, until I make Thy enemies Thy footstool.'" Therefore let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made Him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus Whom ye crucified.

      As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew nor Greek, there is no longer slave nor free, there is no longer male nor female: for all of you are one in Christ.

      Clean out the old yeast so that ye may be a new bathc, as ye really are unleavened. For our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed. Therefore, let us celebrate the festival, not with old yeast, the yeast of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
