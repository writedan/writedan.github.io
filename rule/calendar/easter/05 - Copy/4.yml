      verse: Revelation 21:1-8
      text: >
        I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: "Behold: the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them: they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them: He will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more: mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away."
        
        And the One Who was seated on the throne said: "Behold: I am making all things news. Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true." Then He said to me: "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life. Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their God and they will be My children. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, the murderers, the fornicators, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."

      verse: John 15:1-8
      text: >
        Before the festival of the Passover, Jesus spoke to His disciples: "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. He removes every branch in Me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit He prunces to make it bear more fruit. Ye have already been cleansed by the word I have spoken to you. Abide in Me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can ye unless ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. Those who abide in Me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from Me ye can do nothing. Whoever does not abide in Me is thrown away like a branch and withers: such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If ye abide in Me, and My words in you, ask for whatever ye wish, and it will be done. My Father is glorified by this, that ye bear much fruit and become My disciples."

        Letters V and VI to Diognetus
      text: >
        Christians are indistinguishable from other men either by nationality, language or customs. They do not inhabit separate cities of their own, or speak a strange dialect, or follow some outlandish way of life. Their teaching is not based upon reveries inspired by the curiosity of men. Unlike some other people, they champion no purely human doctrine. With regard to dress, food and manner of life in general, they follow the customs of whatever city they happen to be living in, whether it is Greek or foreign.
        
        And yet there is something extraordinary about their lives. They live in their own countries as though they were only passing through. They play their full role as citizens, but labour under all the disabilities of aliens. Any country can be their homeland, but for them their homeland, wherever it may be, is a foreign country. Like others, they marry and have children, but they do not expose them. They share their meals, but not their wives. They live in the flesh, but they are not governed by the desires of the flesh. They pass their days upon earth, but they are citizens of heaven. Obedient to the laws, they yet live on a level that transcends the law.
        
        Christians love all men, but all men persecute them. Condemned because they are not understood, they are put to death, but raised to life again. They live in poverty, but enrich many: they are totally destitute, but possess an abundance of everything. They suffer dishonor, but that is their glory. They are defamed, but vindicated. A blessing is their answer to abuse, deference their response to insult. For the good they do they receive the punishment of malefactors, but even then they rejoice, as though receiving the gift of life. They are attacked by the Jews as aliens, they are persecuted by the Greeks, yet no one can explain the reason for this hatred.
        
        To speak in general terms, we may say that the Christian is to the world what the soul is to the body. As the soul is present in every part of the body, while remaining distinct from it, so Christians are found in all the cities of the world, but cannot be identified with the world. As the visible body contains the invisible soul, so Christians are seen living in the world, but their religious life remains unseen. The body hates the soul and wars against it, not because of any injury the soul has done it, but because of the restriction the soul places on its pleasures. Similarly, the world hates the Christians, not because they have done it any wrong, but because they are opposed to its enjoyments.
        
        Christians love those who hate them just as the soul loves the body and all its members despite the body’s hatred. It is by the soul, enclosed within the body, that the body is held together, and similarly, it is by the Christians, detained in the world as in a prison, that the world is held together. The soul, though immortal, has a mortal dwelling place; and Christians also live for a time amidst perishable things, while awaiting the freedom from change and decay that will be theirs in heaven. As the soul benefits from the deprivation of food and drink, so Christians flourish under persecution. Such is the Christian’s lofty and divinely appointed function, from which he is not permitted to excuse himself.

      verse: Romans 6:8-11
      text: >
        If we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again: death no longer has dominion over Him. The death He died, He died to sin, once for all: but the life He lives, He lives to God. So ye also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ.

      verse: Colossians 1:11-20
      text: >
        May ye made be strong with all the strength that comes from His glorious power, and may ye be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, Who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the Saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in Whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
        
        He is the Image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation: for in Him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers of powers: all things have been created through Him and for Him. He Himself is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the Church: He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, so that He might come to have first place in everything. For in Him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through Him God was pleased to reconcile to Himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the Blood of His Cross.

      verse: Hebrews 7:23-27
      text: >
        Priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office: but Christ holds His priesthood permanently, because He continues forever. Consequently, He is able for all time to save those who approach God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.
        
        For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, He has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people: this He did once for all when He offered Himself.
