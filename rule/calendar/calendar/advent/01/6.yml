      verse: Isaiah 19:16-24
      text: >
        On that day, Egypt shall be like women, and tremble and fear from the raised hand that the Lord of Armies raises against it. And the land of Judah shall become a terror to Egypt. Whoever mentions it to them shall be afraid because of the counsel of the Lord of Armies that He devises against them. On that day, five cities in the land of Egpyt shall speak the language of Canaan and shall swear to the Lord of Armies. The City of the Sun it shall be said of one of them. On that day the altar of the Lord shall be in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at its border to the Lord. And it shall become a sign and a witness for the Lord of Armies in the land of Egypt that when they cry out to the Lord because of oppressors, He sends them a deliverer and one who contests for them, and He shall save them. And the Lord shall become known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord on that day, and they shall worship with sacrifice and grain offering and make a vow to the Lord and fulfill it. 
        And the Lord shall strike Egypt with plagues, plaguing and healing, and they shall turn back to the Lord, and He shall hear their entreaty and heal them. On that day there shall be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria shall come into Egypt and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt shall worship with Assyria. On that day Israel shall be a third partner with Egypt and with Assyria, as a blessing in the midst of the earth. Which the Lord of Armies conferred, saying: "Blessed are My people Egypt and My handiwork Assyria and Israel My estate."

      verse: Luke 21:25-28
      text: >
        Jesus spoke unto His disciples: "There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on earth distress among the nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of heaven will be shaken. Then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in a cloud' with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise thy heads, because thy redemption is drawing near."

        Proslogion
        Excerpts of Chapter I
        Saint Anselm of Caterbury, Doctor and Bishop

        Insignificant man: escape from thy everyday business for a short while, hide for a moment from thy restless thoughts. Break off from thy cares and troubles and be less concerned about thy tasks and labors. Make a little time for God and rest a while in Him. Enter into thy mind's inner chamber. Shut out everything but God and whatever helps thee to seek Him: and when thou has shut the dorr, look for Him. Speak now to God and say with thy whole heart: "I seek Thy face: Thy face, Lord, I desire."
        
        Lord, my God, teach my heart where and how to seek Thee, where and how to find Thee. Lord, if Thou are not here where shall I look for Thee in Thy absence? Yet if Thou are everywhere, why do I not see Thee when Thou are present? But surely Thou dwell in "light inacessible." And where is light inaccessible? How shall I approach light inaccessible? Or who will lead me and bring me into it that I may see Thee there? And then, by what signs and udner what forms shall I seek Thee? I have never seen Thee, Lord my God: I do not know Thy face. Lord most high, what shall this exile do, so far from Thee? What shall Thy servants do, tormented by love of Thee and cast so far from Thy face? He yearns to see Thee, and Thy face is too far from him. He desires to approach Thee, and Thy dwelling is unapproachable. He longs to find Thee, and does not know Thy dwelling place. He strives to look for Thee, and does not know Thy face.
        
        Lord, Thou are my God, and Thou are my Lord, and I have never seen Thee. Thou has made and remade me, and Thou has given all the good things I possess and still I do not know Thee. I was made in order to see Thee, and I have not yet done that for which I was made. Lord, how long will it be? How long, Lord, will Thou forget us? How long will Thou turn Thy face away from us? When will Thou look upon us and hear us? When will Thou enlighten our eyes and show us Thy face? When will Thou give Thyself back to us?
        
        Look upon us, Lord, hear us and enlighten us, show us Thy very Self. Restore Thyself to us that it may go well with us whose life is so evil without Thee. Take pity on our efforts and our striving toward Thee, for we have no strength apart from Thee. Teach me to seek Thee, and when I seek Thou shows Thyself to me, for I cannot seek Thee unless Thou teaches me, nor can I find Thee unless Thou shows Thyself to me. Let me seek Thee in desiring Thee and desire Thee in seeking Thee: find Thee in loving Thee.

      verse: Jeremiah 30:21-22
      text: |
        Thy leader shall be from Jacob,
          and thy ruler shall come from his midst.
        I will bring him close and he shall approach Me,
          for who would presume to approach Me?
            said the Lord.
        
        And thou shall become My people:
          I will be thy God.

      verse: Revelation 15:3-4
      text: |
        Great and amazing are Thy deeds,
          Lord God the Almighty.
        Just and true are Thy ways,
          King of the nations.
        Lord, who will not fear
          and glorify Thy Name?
        For Thou alone are holy.
          All nations will come
            and worship before Thee,
        for Thy judgments have been revealed.

      verse: 2 Peter 3:8-9
      text: >
        Do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some think of slowness, but is patient with thee, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance.
