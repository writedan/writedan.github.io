      verse: Isaiah 2:6-22, 4:2-6
      text: |
        For thou has abandoned the ways of thy people,
          O house of Jacob.
        For they are full of eastern things:
          soothsayers like the Philistines,
            and they abound in the children of strangers.
        And his land is filled with silver and gold
          and no end to his treasures,
        and his land is filled with houses
          and no end to his chariots.
        And his land is filled with idols
          to his handiwork he bows down:
            to what his fingers made.
        And the human shall bow low,
          and man shall be brought down,
            and he shall not be spared.
        Came into the crags
          and hide in the dust
        for fear of the Lord
          and from His majesty's glory.
        The eyes of human haughtiness are brought down,
          and men's righteousness is bowed low,
        and the Lord alone shall be raised high
          on that day.
        For it is a day of the Lord of Armies,
          over all the proud and lofty
            and over all on high and lifted up.
        And over all Lebanon cedars
          that are lofty and raised high,
            and over all the Bashan oaks,
        and over all the lofty mountains,
          and over all the raised-up mountains,
        and over every looming tower
          and over every fortress wall,
        and over all the Tarshish ships
          and over all lovely crafts.
        And the ungodly shall utterly vanish.
        
        And they shall come into caves in crags
          and into hollows in the dust
        from fear of the Lord
          and from His majesty's glory
            when He rises to wreck havoc on the earth.
        On that day man shall fling away
          his silver idols and his golden idols
        that he made to bow before
          to the hedgehogs and the bats.
        And they shall come into the crevices in the crags
          and into the clefts in the rock
        from fear of the Lord
          and from His majesty's glory
            when He rises to wreck havoc on the earth.
        Turn away from man,
          who has breath in his nostrils,
            for of what account is he?
            
        On that day the Lord's shoot shall become
          beauty and glory,
        and the fruit of the land
          pride and splendor
            for the remnant of Israel.
        And who remains in Zion
          and who is left in Jerusalem:
        "holy" shall be said of him
          each who is written for life in Jerusalem.
        The King shall surely wash the filth of the daughters of Zion,
          and Jerusalem's bloodguilt He shall cleanse from its midst
            with a wind of justice and a wind of rooting-out.
        And the Lord shall create over all the sanctuary of Mount Zion
          and over its solemn assemblies
        a cloud by day
          and an effulgence of flaming fire by night,
            for over all the glory there shall be a canopy.
        and a shelter it shall be
          as a shade by day from heart
            and a covert and refuge from pelting rain.

      verse: Luke 10:23-24

        Turning to His disciples, Jesus said to them privately: "Blessed are the eyes that see what thou sees. For I tell thee that many prophets and kings desired to see what thou sees, but did not see it: and to hear what thou hears, but did not hear it."

        Oration 45
        Excerpts of Chapters IX, XXII, XXVI, and XXVIII
        Saint Gregory Nazianzen, Doctor and Bishop
      text: >
        The very Son of God, older than the ages, the invisible, the incomprehensible, the incorporeal, the beginning of beginning, the light of light, the fountain of life and immortality, the image of the archetype, the immovable seal, the perfect likeness, the definition and word of the Father: He it is Who comes to His own image and takes our nature for the good of our nature, and unites Himself to an intelligent soul for the good of my soul, to purify like by like. He takes to Himself all that is human, except sin. He was conceived by the Virgin Mary, who had been first prepared in soul and body by the Spirit: His coming to birth had to be treated with honor: virginity had to receive new honor. He comes forth as God in the human nature He was taken: one being, made of two contrary elements: flesh and spirit. Spirit gave divinity, flesh received it.
        
        He Who makes rich is made por: he takes on the poverty of my flesh, that I may gain the riches of His divinity. He Who is full is made empty: He is emptied for a brief space of His glory, that I may share in His fullness. What is this wealth of goodness? what is this mystery that surrounds Me? I received the likeness of God, but failed to keep it. He takes on my flesh, to bring salvation to the image, immortality to the flesh. He enters into a second union with us, a union far more wonderful than the first.
        
        Holiness had to be brought to man by the humanity assumed by One Who was God, so that God might overcome the tyrant by force and so deliver us back to Himself through the mediation of His Son. The Son arranged this for the honor of the Father, to whom the Son is clearly obedient in all things. The Good Shepherd, Who lays down His life for the sheep, came in search of the straying sheep to the mountains and hills no which thou used to offer sacrifice. When He found it, He took it on the shoulders that bore the wood of the Cross, and led it back to the life heaven.
        
        Christ, the light of all lights, follows John, the lamp that goes before Him. The Word of God follows the voice in the wilderness: the bridegroom follows the bridegroom's friend, who prepares a worthy people for the Lord by cleansing them by water in preparation for the Spirit. We need God to take our flesh and die, that we might live. We have died with Him, that we may be purified. We have risen again with Him, because we have died with Him. We have been glorified with Him, because we have ben risen again with Him.

        The scepter shall not pass from Judah,

        I give thanks to God always for thee because of the grace that God has given thee in our Christ, Jesus, for in every way thou has been enriched in Him: in speech and knowledge of every kind: just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among thee: so that thou are not lacking in any spiritual greace as thou waits for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He wil lalso strengthen thee to the end, so that thou may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful: by Him thou were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
