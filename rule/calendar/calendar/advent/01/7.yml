      verse: Isaiah 21:6-10, 12

        For thus said the King to me:
        Go, post a watchman
          who will see and tell.
        And he shall see a rider,
          a pair of horsemen,
        a rider on a donkey,
          a rider on a camel.
        And he shall listen intently,
          with great intentness.
        And the seer shall cry out:
        "On the King's lookout
          I stand perpetually by day
            and on my watch I am stationed all through the nights.
        And behold: it is coming:
          a man riding, a pair of horsemen."
        And He answered and said:
          "Babylon surely has fallen
            and all its gods and idols I have dashed to the ground.
        My threshing and what falls on the granary floor."
        
        To me someone calls from Seir:
          "Watchman, what of the night?
            Watchman, what of the night?"
        The watchman said: "The morning comes,
          and night as well.
        If thou would ask, do ask,
          return, come back."

        Treatise on the Value of Patience
        Cahpters XIII and XV
        Saint Cyprian, Bishop and Martyr
      text: >
        Patience is a precept for salvation given to us by our Lord our teacher: "Whoever endures to the end will be saved." And again: "If thou perserveres in My word, thou will truly be My disciple." And: "Thou will know the Truth, and the Truth will set thee free."
        
        Dear brethren, we must endure and persevere if we are to attain the truth and fredom we have been allowed to hope for: faith and hope and the very meaning of our being Christians, but if faith and hope are to bear their fruit, patience is necessary. We do not seek glory now, in the present, but we look for future glory, as Saint Paul instructs us when he says: "By hope we were saved. Now hope which is seen is not hope: how can a man hope for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it in patience. Patient waiting is necessary if we are to be perfected in what we have begun to be, and if we are to receive from God what we hope for and believe." In another place the same Apostles instructs and teaches the just, and those active in good works, and those who store up for themselves treasures in heaven through the reward God gives them. They are to be patient also, for he says: "Therefore while we have time, let us do good to all, but especially to those who are of the household
        of the faith. But let us not grow weary in doing good, for we shall reap our reward in due season." Paul warns us not grow weary in good works through impatience, not to be distracted or overcome by temptations and so give up in the midst of our pilgrimage of praise and glory, and allow our past good deeds to count for nothing because what was begun falls short of completion. 
        
        Finally the Apostle, speaking of charity, unites it with endurance and patience. "Charity," he says, is always patient and kind: "it is not jealous, is not boastful, is not given to anger, does not think evil, loves all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." He shows that charity can be steadfast and persevering because it has learned how to endure all things. And in another place he says: "Bear with another lovingly, striving to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." He shows that neither unity nor peace can be maintained unless the brethren cherish each other with mutual forbearance and preserve the bond of harmony by means of patience.

      verse: "Revelation 18: 2, 4-5"
      text: |
        Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great.
          It has become a dwelling place of demons,
        a haunt of every foul spirit,
          a haunt of every bird,
            a haunt of every foul and hateful beast.
       
        "Come out of her, My people,
          so that thou does not take part in her sins,
        and so that thou does not share in her plagues:
          for her sins are heaped high as heaven,
            and God has rembered her iniquites."

      verse: Philippians 2:5-11
      text: >
        Let the same mind be in thee that was in our Christ, Jesus, Who, though He was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And being found in human form, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death: even to death on the Cross. Therefore God also highly exalted Him and gave Him the Name that is above every name, so that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

        May the God of peace Himself sanctify thee entirely: and may thy spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
