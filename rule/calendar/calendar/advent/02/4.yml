      verse: Isaiah 25:6-26:6

        And the Lord shall prepare a banquet for all the peoples on this mountain, a banquet of rich food, a banquet of well-aged wins, rich food with marrow, well-aged wines fine strained. And He shall swallow up on this mountain the veil that covers all the peoples and the mantle cast over all the nations. He shall swallow up death foreer, and the King the Lord shall wipe tears from every face, and His people's disgrace He shall take off from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken. And it shall be said on that day:
        
        "Behold: this is our God
          in Whom we hoped, and He rescued us.
        This is our own God in Whom we hoped:
          let us exult and rejoice in His rescue."
        For the Lord's hand shall rest on this mountain,
          and Moab shall be threshed beneath Him
            as straw is threshed in a cesspool.
        and he shall spread his arms within it
          as the swimmer spreads his arms to swim
            and his pride shall be brought low
              and his arms churn.
        The towering fortress of their walls He shall bring down,
          bring it low, level it with the ground.
          
        On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
        "A strong city is ours.
          Victory will be set: walls and ramparts.
        Open the gates
          and let a righteous nation enter,
            keeping faith.
        A steadfast nature Thou guards in peace
          for in Thee it trusts.
        Trust in the Lord forever,
          for in God the Lord is an everlasting Rock.
        for He has brought low the dwellers on high:
          the lofty city,
        brought down, brought it down to the earth,
          leveled it with dust.
        The foot tramples it,
          the feet of the needy,
            the poor man's footsteps."

        Jesus spoke unto the crowds: "Come to Me, all thee that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give thee rest. Take My yoke upon thee: for I am gentle and humble in heart, and thou will find rest for thy souls. for My yoke is easy, and My burden is light."

        Commentary on the Psalms
        On Psalm CIX, Chapters I, II, and III
        Saint Augustine of Hippo, Doctor and Bishop
      text: >
        God established a time for His promises and a time for their fulfillment. The time for promises was in the time of the prophets: until John the Baptist: from John unto the end is the time of fulfillment.
        
        God, Who is faithful, put Himself in our debt, not by receiving anything but by promising so much. A promise was not sufficient for Him: He chose to committ Himself in writing as well, as it were making a contract of His promises. He wanted us to be able to see the way in which His promises were redeemed when He began to discharge them. and so the time of the prohpets was, as we have often said, the foretelling of the promises. He promised eternal salvation, everlasting happiness with the Angels, an immortal inheritance, endless glory, the joyful vision of His face, His holy dwelling in heaven, and after resurrection from the dead no further fear of dying. This is as it were His final promise: the goal of all our striving. When we reach it, we shall ask for nothing more. but as to the way in which we are to arrive at our final goal, He has revealed this also, by promise and prophecy. He has promised men divinity, mortal immortality, sinners justificaiton, and the poor a rising to glory.
        
        But brethren, because God's promises eem impossible to me: equality with the Angels in exchange for mortality, corruption, poverty, weakness, dust and ashes: God not only made a written contract with men, to win their belief, but also established a mediator of His good faith, not a prince or Angel, but His only Son. He wanted, through His Son, to show us and give us the way He qwould lead us to the goal He has promised. It was not enough for God to make His Son our guide to the way: He made Him the way itself, that thou might travel with Him as leader, and by Him as the way.
        
        Therefore, the only Son of God was to come among men, to take the nature of men, and in this nature to be born as a man. He was to die, to rise again, to ascend into heaven, to sit at the right hand of the Father, and to fulfill His promises among the nations, and after that to come again, to exact now what He had asked for before, to separate those deserving His anger from those deserving His mercy, to execute His threats against the wicked, and to reward the just as He had promised. All this had therefore to be prophesized, foretold, and impressed upon us as an event in the future, in order that we might wait for it in faith, not find it in a sudden and dreadful reality.

        Do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, Who will bring light to things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.
