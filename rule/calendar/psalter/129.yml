verses:
  - text: |
      Much they beset me from my youth,
        let Israel now say,
  - text: |
      much they beset me from my youth,
        yet they did not prevail over me.
  - text: |
      My back the harrowers harrowed,
        they drew a long furrow.
  - text: |
      The Lord is just.
        He has slashed the bonds of the wicked.
  - text: |
      May they be shamed and fall back,
        all the haters of Zion.
  - text: |
      May they be like the grass on the rooftops
        that the east wind withers,
  - text: |
      with which no reaper fills his hand,
        no binder of sheaves his bosom,
  - text: |
      and no passerby to say, "The Lord's blessing upon thee.
        We bless thee in the Name of the Lord."
