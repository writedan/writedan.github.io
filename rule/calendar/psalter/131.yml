verses:
  - text: |
      Lord, my hear has not been haughty,
        nor have my eyes looked too high,
      nor have I striven for greast things,
        nor for things too wondrous for me.
  - text: |
      But I have calmed and contented myself
        like a weaned baby on its mother:
      like a weaned baby I am with myself.
  - text: |
      Wait, O Israel, for the Lord,
        now and forevermore.
