ANTIPHON
advent  This is the good news the Prophets foretold: the Savior will be born of the Virgin Mary.
        The nations will revere Thy Name, O Lord.
        And the great ones of the earth will acknowledge Thy glory.
        The Angel Gabriel said to Mary in greeting: "Hail full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed are thou among women."
        Remember us, Lord, because of the love Thou has for Thy people.
        Come and bring us Thy salvation.
        Mary said: "My soul is deeply troubled: what can this greeting mean? Am I to give birth to my King and yet remain a virgin forever?"
        Come, Lord, do not delay.
        Free Thy people from their sinfulness.
