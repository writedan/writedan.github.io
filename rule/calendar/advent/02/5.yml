      verse: Isaiah 26:7-21
      text: |
        The path of the righteous is straight,
          a straight coruse for the righteous Thou paves.
        The path of Thy judgments
          we hoped for, O Lord.
        For Thy Name and repute
          are our utmost desire.
        With my spirit I desired Thee by night,
          with my spirit within me I sought Thee.
        For when Thy judgments are on earth,
          the world's dwellers learn righteousness.
        Should the wicked be spared, he does not learn righteousness,
          on earth he twists what is straight,
            and he does not see the Lord's majesty.
        O Lord, when Thy hand is raised,
          they do not look,
        let them look and be shamed by the zeal for the people,
          by the fire consuming Thy foes.
        O Lord, grant peace to us,
          for our every act Thou has wrought for us.
        O Lord our God,
          kings besides Thee possess us.
            Thy Name alone we invoke.
        The dead shall not live

        Jesus spoke unto the crowds: "Truly I tell thee: among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist: yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesized until John come: and if thou are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come."

        Sermon CXLVII
        Chapter LII
        Saint Peter Chrysologus, Doctor and Bishop
      text: >
        When God saw the world falling to ruin because of fear, He immediately acted to call it back to Himself with love. He invented it by His greace, preserved it by His love, and embraced it with compassion. When the earth became hardened in evil, God sent the Flood both to punish and to release it. He called Noah to be the father of a new era, urged him with kind words, and showed that He trusted him: He gave him fatherly instruction about the present calamity, and through His graces consoled him with hope for the future. But God did not merely issue commands: rather with Noah sharing the work, He filled the ark with the future seed of the whole world. The sense of loving fellowship thus engendered removed servile fear, and a mutual love could continue to preserve what shared labor had effected.
        
        God called Abraham out of the heathen world, symbolically lengthened his name, and made him the father of all believers. God walked with him on his journeys, protected him in foreign lands, enriched him with earthly possessions, and honored him with victories. He made a covenant with him, saved him from harm, accepted his hospitality, and astonished him by giving him the offspring he had despaired of. Favored with so many graces and drawn by such sweetness of divine love, Abraham was to learn to love God rather than fear Him, and love rather than fear was to inspire his worship.
        
        God comforted Jacob by a dream during his flight, roused him to combat upon his return, and encircled him with a wrestler's embrace to teach him not to be afraid of the author of the conflict, but to love him. God called Moses as a father would, and with fatherly affection invited him to become the liberator of His people.
        
        In all these events we have recalled, the flame of divine love enkindled human hearts and its intoxication overflowed into men's senses. Wounded by love, they longed to look upon God with their bodily eyes. Yet how could our narrow human vision apprehend God, Whom the whole world cannot contain? But the law of love is not concerned with what will be, what ought to be, what can be. Love does not reflect: it is unreasonable and knows no moderation. Love refuses to be consoled when its goal proves impossible, despises all hindrances to the attainment of its object. Love destroys thelover if he cannot obtain what he loves: love follows its own promptings, and does not think of right and wrong. Love inflames desire which impels it toward things that are forbidden. It is intolerable for love not to see the object of its longing. That is why whatever reward they merited was nothing to the Saints if they could not see the Lord. A love that desires to se God may not have reasonableness on its side, but it is
        the evidence of filial love. It gave Moses the temerit to say: "If I have found favor in Thy eyes, show me Thy face." It inspired the Psalmist to make the same prayer: "Show me Thy face." Even the pagans made their idols for this purpose: they wanted to actually see what they mistakenly revered.

        Many of the sleepers in the soil of the earth shall awake: some for everlasting life and some for disgrace and everlasting shame.

      verse: Revelation 11:17-18, 12:10-12
      text: |
        We give Thee thanks, Lord God the Almighty,
          Who are and Who were,
        for Thou has taken Thy great power
          and begun to reign.
        The nations raged,
          but Thy wrath has come,
            and the time for judging the dead,
        for rewarding Thy servants, the prophets
          and Saints and all who fear Thy Name,
            both small and great,
        and for destroying those who destroy the earth.

      verse: James 5:7-9

        Be patient, beloved, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth, being patient with it until it receives the early and late rains. Thou must also be patient. Strengthen thy hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. Beloved, do not grumble against one another, so that thou may not be judged. Behold: the Judge is standing at the doors.
