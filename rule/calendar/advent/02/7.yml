        Woe, Ariel, lion of God,
          the city where David campled.
        Add year upon year,
          let festivals make their round.
        And I shall cause distress to Ariel,
          and it shall turn into keening and crying,
            and it shall be to me as Ariel.
        And I shall camp like David against it,
          and besiege it with a mound
            and lay siege against it.
        And thou shall be brought down, from the ground thou shall speak,
          lower than the dust shall thy utterance be,
        and thy voice shall be like a ghost from the ground,
          and from the dust thy speaking shall chirp.
        And the crowd of thy strangers shall be like fine dust
          and like chaff blowing past the oppressors' crowd.
            And it shall happen at once in a moment,
        she shall be singled out by the Lord of Armies
          in thunder and earthquake and a great sound,
            tempest and whirlwind and tongues of consuming fire.
        and it shall be like a dream, a night vision:
          the crowd of all nations arrayed against Ariel
        and all her foes and the siege against her
          and those who distressed her.
        and it shall be as the hungry man dreams he is eating,
          and wakes with an empty throat,
        and as the thirsty man dreams he is drinking
          and wakes and is faint and his throat is parched,
        so the crowd of all nations shall be,
          arrayed against Mount Zion.

      verse: Matthew 17:9-13
      text: >
        As they were coming down from the mountain, His disciples asked Jesus: "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" He replied: "Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things: but I tell thee that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands." Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist.

      verse: Deuteronomy 32:1-12
      text: |
        "Give ear, O heavens, that I may speak,
          and let the earth hear my mouth's utterances.
        Let my teaching drop like rain,
          my saing flow like dew,
        like showers on the green
          and like cloudburts on the grass.
        For the Name of the Lord do I call.
          Hail greatness for our God.
        The Rock, His acts are perfect,
          for all His ways are justice.
        A steadfast God without wrong,
          true and right is He.
        Did He act ruinously? No, His sons are at fault:
          a perverse and twisted brood.
        To the Lord will thou requite thus,
          base and unwise people?
        Is He not thy Father, thy Shaper,
          He made thee and set thee unshaken?
        Remember the days of old,
          give thought to the years of times past.
        Ask thy father, that he may tell thee,
          thy elders, that they may say to thee.
        When God gave estates to nations,
          when He split up the sons of Adam,
        He set out the boundaries of peoples,
          by the number of the sons of Israel.
        The Lord's portion is His people,
          Jacob the parcel of His estate.
        He found him in the wilderness land,
          in the waste of the howling desert.
        He encricled him, gave mind to him,
          watched him like the apple of His eye.
        Like an eagle who rouses his neast,
          over his fledglings he hovers,
        He spread His wings, He took him,
          He bore him on His pinion.
        The Lord alone did lend him,
          no alien god by His side.

      verse: Philippians 2:5-11
      text: >
        Let the same mind be in thee that was in our Christ, Jesus, Who, though He was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And being found in human form, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death: even to death on the Cross. Therefore God also highly exalted Him and gave Him the Name that is above every name, so that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

        May the God of peace Himself sanctify thee entirely: and may thy spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
