      verse: Isaiah 22:8-23
      text: |
        Ye looked on that day
          to the weapon-store of the Forest House.
        And the breaches of the City of David
          ye watched as they grew many
            and ye collected the waters of the Lower Pool.
        And ye counted Jerusalem's houses
          and demolished the houses to fortify the wall.
        And a basin ye made between the double walls
          for the waters of the Old Pool.
        But ye did not look to Him Who did it,
          and its Fashioner from afar ye did not see.
        And the King Lord of Armies
          called on that day
        for weeping and keening
          and shaved heads and the girding of sackcloth.
        And behold: gladness and joy,
          killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep,
        eating of meat and drinking of wine:
          "Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
        And in my ears the Lord of Armies was revealed:
          "This crime shall not be atoned for you
            until ye die," said the King Lord of Armies.
            
        Thus said the King Lord of Armies:
        "Go to this steward,
          Shebna, who is over the house.
        'What has thou here and whom has thou here
          that thou hewed thyself here a tomb?
        Who hews a tomb on high
          carves into the cliff an abode for himself?
        The Lord is about to shake thee
          as one shakes a garment, and wrap thee around:
        He shall surely wind thee around like a turban
          away to a spacious land.
        There shall thou die,
          and there the chariots of thy honor
            shall be the shame of thy master's house.
        And I will knock thee away from thy station
          and from thy stand thou shall be torn.'
          
        And on that day I shall call to my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah. And I shall clothe him with thy robe and bind him with thy sash and give thy authority to his hand. And he shall become a father for the dwellers of Jerusalem and for the house of Judah. And I shall place the key of the house of David on his shoulder, and when he opens, none shall lock, and when he locks, none shall open. And I shall affix him as a peg in a solid place, and he shall be a seat of honor for his father's house."

      verse: Matthew 3:1-12
      text: >
        In those days John the Baptist appeared in the wildnerness of Judea, proclaiming: "Repent, for the kingdom of God has come near." This is the one of whom the Prophet Isaiah spoke when he said: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.'" John wore clothing of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waiste, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea were going out to him, and all the region along the Jordan, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
        
        But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them: "Ye brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit worthy of repentance. Do not presume to say to yourself, 'We have Abraham as our ancestor,' for I tell you: God is able from these stones to raise up children of Abraham. Even now the axe is lying at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
        
        "I baptize you with water for repentance, but One Who is more powerful than I is coming after me: I am not worthy to carry His sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will clear His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into the granary: but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire."

        Commentary on Isaiah
        Chapter XL
        Eusebius of Caesarea
      text: >
        "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God.'" The prophecy makes clear that it is to be fulfilled not in Jerusalem, but in the wilderness: it is there that the glory of the Lord is to appear, and God's salvation is to be made known to all mankind. It was in the wilderness that God's saving presence was proclaimed by John the Baptist, and there that God's salvation was seen. The words of this prophecy were fulfilled when Christ and His glory were made manifest to all: after His baptism the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove rested on Him, and the Father's voice was heard, bearing witness to His Son: "This is My beloved Son: listen to Him."
        
        The prophecy meant that God was to come to a deserted place, inaccessible from the beginning. None of the pagans had any knowledge of God, since His holy servants and prophets were kept from approaching them. The voice commands that a way be prepared for the Word of God: the rough and trackless ground is to be made level, so that our God may find a highway when He comes. "Prepare the way of the Lord": the way is the preaching of the Gospel, the new message of consolation, ready to bring to all mankind the knowledge of God's saving power.
        
        "Climb on a mountain, bearer of good news to Zion. Left up your voices in strength, bearer of good news to Jerusalem." These words harmonize well with the meaning of what has gone before. They refer opportunely to the evangelists and proclaim this coming of God to men, after speaking of voices crying in the wilderness. Mention of the evangelists suitably follows the prophecy on John the Baptist. What does Zion mean if not the city previously called Jerusalem? this is the mountain referred to in that passage from Scripture: "Here is mount Zion, where thou dwelt." The Apostle says: "Thou has come to mount Zion." Does not this refer to the company of the Apostles, chosen from the former people of the circumcision? This is the Zion, the Jerusalem, that received God's salvation. It stands aloft on the mountain of God, that is, it is raised high on the only-begotten Word of God. It is commanded to climb the high mountain and announce the word of salvation. Who is the bearer of the good news but the company
        of the evangelists? what does it mean to bear the good news but to preach to all nations, but first of all to the cities of Judah, the coming of Christ on earth?

      verse: Revelation 3:7, 8
      text: |
        These are the words of the holy One, the true One,
          Who has the key of David,
            Who opens and no one will shut,
              Who shuts and no one opens:
              
        "I know thy works. Behold: I have set before thee an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that thou has but little power, and yet thou has kept My word and has not denied My Name."

        Alleluia!
        Salvation and glory and power to our God:
          for His judgments are true and just:

        all who fear Him,

          and His bride has made herself ready.

        Commentary on the Prophecies of Isaiah
        Book IV, Chapter XI
        Saint Jerome, Doctor and Priest
      text: >
        "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse." From the beginning of the Book of this Prophet until the thirteenth chapter, where commences the vision of Babylon, the whole of the vision of Isaiah is one continual prophecy of Christ. We must explain it part by part, for if we were to take it all at once, the memory of the reader would be confused. According to the Jewish commentators, the rod and the flower both relate to the Lord Himself. They take the rod to mean the sceptre of His royal dominion, and the flower the loveliness of His beauty.
        
        We, however, understand that the rod out of the root of Jesse signifies the holy Virgin Mary. She was a clean stem that had as yet put forth no shoot: as we have read above: "Behold, the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son." And the flower we believe to mean the Lord our Redeemer, Who has elsewhere compared Himself to a flower: "I am a flower of the plain, and a lily of the valleys."
        
        The Spirit of the Lord then shall rest upon this flower: this flower which shall come forth from the stem and roots of Jesse by means of the Virgin Mary. And truly the Spirit of the Lord did rest upon our Redeemer. It is written that in Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily. The Spirit was not shed on Him by measure, as it is upon the Saints. To Him we may apply the words of the Hebrew Gospel used by the Nazarenes: "The whole fountain of the Holy Spirit shall be poured forth upon Him. The Lord is a spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
