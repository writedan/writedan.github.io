      verse: Isaiah 24:1-18
      text: |
        The Lord is about to sap the earth and strip it,
          contort its face and scatter its dwellers.
        And the plain people shall be like the priest,
          and the slave like his master, 
        the buyer like the seller, the lender like the borrower,
          the creditor like him who seeks credit.
        Sapped indeed: sapped shall the land be,
          and plundered indeed:
            for the Lord has spoken thus.
        The earth is bleak, has withered,
          forlorn, the world has withered,
            for the heights of the earth's folk forlorn.
        And the earth is tainted beneath its dwellers
          for they transgressed teachings, flouted law,
            broke the eternal covenant.
        Therefore has a curse consumed the earth,
          and all its dwellers are mired in guilt.
        Therefore earth's dwellers turn pale,
          and but a few humans remain.
        The new wine is flat,
          the vine forlorn,
            all the merry-hearted groan.
        The gladness of timbrels is gone,
          the revelers' clamor ended,
            the lyre's gladness has gone.
        With no song do they drink wine,
          strong drink turns bitter to its drinkers.
        The futile city has been broken,
          every house is closed to entrance.
        A scream over wine in the streets,
          on all joy the sun has set,
            the earth's gladness has gone away.
        In the town desolation remains,
          and the gate is smashed to ruins.
        For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth,
          in the heart of the peoples,
        as olives are beaten,
          lke gleanings as the harvest is done.
        It is they who shall raise their voice, sing gladly,
          in God's grandeur they shall shout out from the sea,
        in the coastlands of the sea,
          the Name of the Lord, God of Israel.
        From the edge of the earth,
          we have heard songs: splendor to the righteous.
        And I said: I have a secret, I have a secret: woe is me.
          Traitors betrayed, in betrayal betrayed.
        Terror and pitfall and trap
          against thee, dweller of the land.
        And who flees from the sound of terror
          shall fall into the Pit
            and who gets up from the Pit shall be caught in a trap.

      verse: Mark 1:2-8

        As it is written in the Prophet Isaiah:
        
        "Behold: I am sending my messenger ahead of thee,
          who will prepare thy way:
        the voice of one crying out in the wilderness:
          'Prepare the way of the Lord,
            make his paths straight.'"
        
        Thus John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed: "The One Who is more powerful than I is coming after me: I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals. I have baptized thee with water: but He will baptize thee with the Holy Spirit."

        The Ascent of Mount Carmel
        Book II, Chapter XXII
        Saint John of the Cross, Doctor and Priest
      text: >
        Under the ancient law, prophets and priests saught from God revelations and visions which indeed they needed, for faith had as yet no firm foundation and the gospel law had not yet been established. Their seeking and God's responses were necessary. He spoke to them at one time through words and visions and revelations, at another in signs and symbols. But however He responded and what He said and revealed were mysteries of our holy faith, either partial glimpses of the whole or sure movements toward it.
        
        But now that faith is rooted in Christ, and the law of the gospel has been proclaimed in this time of grace, there is no need to seek Him in the former manner, nor for Him so to respond. By giving us, as He did, His Son, His only Word, He has in that one Word said everything. There is no need for any further revelation. This is the true meaning of Paul's words to the Hebrews when he urged them to abandon their earlier ways of conversing with God, as laid down in the law of Moses, and set their eyes on Christ alone: "In the past God spoke to our fathers through the prophets in various ways and manners: but now in our times, the last days, He has spoken to us in His Son." In effect, Paul is saying that God has spoken so completely through His own Word that He chooses to add nothing. Although He had spoken but partially through the prophets, He has now said everything in Christ. He has given us everything: His only Son. 
        
        Therefore, anyone who wished to question God or seek some new vision or revelation from Him would commit an offense: for instead of focusing his eyes entirely on Christ, he would be desiring something other than Christ, or beyond Him. God could then answer: "This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased: hear Him. In My Word I have already said everything. Fix thy eyes on Him alone for in Him I have revealed all and in Him thou will find more than thou could ever ask for or desire. I, with My holy Spirit, came down upon Him on Mount Tabor and declared: 'This is My beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased: hear Him.' Thou does not need new teachings or ways of learning from Me, for when I spoke before it was of Christ Who was to come, and when they sought anything of Me they were but seeking and hoping for Christ in Whom is every good, as the whole teaching of the evangelists and apostles clearly testifies."

      verse: Isaiah 2:3
      text: |
        Many peoples shall go and say:
        
        "Come, let us go up to the mount of the Lord,
          to the house of the God of Jacob,
        that He may teach us of His ways
          and that we may walk in His paths."

      verse: Ephesians 1:3-10
      text: >
        Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places: just as He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him in love. He destined us for adoption as His children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace that He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His Blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace that He lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight, He has made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure that He set forth in Christ, as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in Him: things in heaven and things on earth.

      verse: Philippians 3:20-21
      text: >
        Our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the Body of His glory, by the power that also enables Him to make all things subject to Himself.
