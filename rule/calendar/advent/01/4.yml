      verse: Isaiah 25:6-9
      text: |
        And the Lord shall prepare a banquet for all the peoples on this mountain, a banquet of rich food, a banquet of well-aged wines, rich food with marrow, well-aged wines fine strained. And He shall swallow up on this mountain the veil that covers all the peoples and the mantle cast over all the nations. He shall swallow up death foreer, and the King the Lord shall wipe tears from every face, and His people's disgrace He shall take off from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken. And it shall be said on that day:
        
        "Behold: this is our God
          in Whom we hoped, and He rescued us.
        This is our own God in Whom we hoped:
          let us exult and rejoice in His rescue."

        Jesus spoke unto His disciples: "Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day does not catch you unexpectedly like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the earth. Be alert at all times, praying that ye may have the strength to escape all these things what will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."

        Sermon V
        "God's Word will come to us"
        Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, Doctor and Abbot
      text: >
        We know that there are three comings of the Lord. The third lies between the other two. It is invisible, while the other two are visible. In the first coming He was seen on earth, dwelling among men; He Himself testifies that they saw Him and hated Him. In the final coming "all flesh will see the salvation of our God," and "they will look on Him whom they pierced." The intermediate coming is a hidden one: in it only the elect see the Lord within their own selves, and they are saved. In His first coming our Lord came in our flesh and in our weakness: in this middle coming He comes in spirit and in power: in the final coming He will be seen in glory and majesty.
        
        In case someone should think that what we say about this middle coming is sheer invention, listen to what our Lord Himself says: "If anyone loves Me, He will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him." There is another passage of Scripture which reads: "He who fears God will do good," but something further has been said about the one who loves, that is, that he will keep God’s word. Where is God’s word to be kept? Obviously in the heart, as the Prophet says: "I have hidden Thy words in my heart, so that I may not sin against Thee."
        
        Keep God’s word in this way. Let it enter into thy very being, let it take possession of thy desires and thy whole way of life. Feed on goodness, and thy soul will delight in its richness. Remember to eat thy bread, or thy heart will wither away. Fill thy soul with richness and strength.
        
        Because this coming lies between the other two, it is like a road on which we travel from the first coming to the last. In the first, Christ was our redemption: in the last, He will appear as our life: in this middle coming, He is our rest and consolation.
        
        If thou keeps the word of God in this way, it will also keep thee. The Son with the Father will come to thee. The great Prophet who will build the new Jerusalem will come, the one who makes all things new. This coming will fulfill what is written: "As we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, we shall also bear the likeness of the heavenly man." Just as Adam’s sin spread through all mankind and took hold of all, so Christ, who created and redeemed all, will glorify all, once He takes possession of all.

      verse: Isaiah 7:14-15, 9:5-6
      text: >
        Therefore the King Himself shall give thee a sign: the virgin is about to conceive and bear a Son, and she shall call His Name Immanuel. Curds and honey He shall eat until He knows how to reject evil and choose good.
        
        For a Child has been born to us,
          a Son has been given to us,
            and leadership is on His shoulders.
        And His Name is called Wondrous Councillor,
          Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace
        making leadership abound and peace without end
          on the throne of David and over his kingdom
        to make it firm-founded and stay it up
          in justice and righteousness forever more.
        The zeal of the Lord of Armies shall do this.

        May thou be made strong with all the strength that comes from His glorious power, and may thou be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, Who has enabled thee to share in the inheritance of the Saints in the light.

      verse: 1 Corinthians 4:5
      text: >
        Do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, Who will bring light to things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.
