        How was the faithful town
          become a whore?
        Filled with justice,
          where righteousness did lodge,
            and now murderers.
        Thy silver has turned to dross,
          thy drink is mixed with water.
        Thy nobles are knaves
          and companions to thieves.
        All of them lust for bribes
          and chase illicit payments.
        They do not defend the orphan,
          and the widow's case does not touch them.
        Therefore, says the King, the Lord of Armies, Israel's Savior:
          "I will settle scores with my foes
            and take vengeance of my enemies,
        and bring My hand back upon thee
          and take away all thy dross
        and bring back thy Judges as before
          and thy councillors as long ago.
        Then shall thou be called town of righteousness,
          faithful city."
        Zion shall be redeemed through justice,
          and those who turn back in her, through righteousness.
          
        And it shall happen in future days
          that the mount of the Lord's house shall be firm-founded
            at the top of the mountains and lifted over the hills.
        And all the nations shall flow to it
          and many peoples shall go and say:
        "Come, let us go up to the mount of the Lord,
          to the house of the God of Jacob,
        that He may teach us of His ways
          and that we may walk in His paths."
        For from Zion shall teaching come forth
          and the Lord's word from Jerusalem.
        And He shall judge among the nations
          and be arbiter for many peoples.
        And they shall grind their swords into plowshares
          and their spears into pruning hooks.
        Nation shall not raise sword against nation
          nor shall they learn war anymore.
        O house of Jacob,
          come: let us walk in the Lord's light.

      verse: Mark 13:33-37

        Jesus spoke unto His disciples: "Beware, keep alert: for thou does not know when the time will come. It is like a man going on a journey: when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch/ Therefore, keep awake: for thou does not know when the master of the house will come: in the evening, at midnight, or at the dawn, or in the morning: or else he may find thee asleep when he comes suddenly. And what I say to thee I say to all: 'Keep awake.'"

        Pastoral Letter on the Season of Advent
        Saint Charles Borromeo, Bishop
      text: >
        Beloved: now is the acceptable time spoken of by the Spirit, the day of salvation, peace and reconciliation: the great season of Advent. This is the time eagerly awaited by the Patriarchs and Prophets, the time that holy Simeon rejoiced at last to see. This is the season that the Church has always celebrated with special solemnity. We too should always observe it with faith and love, offering praise and thanksgiving to the Father for the mercy and love He was shown us in this mystery. In His infinite love for us, though we were sinnrs, He sent His only Son to free us from the tyranny of Satan, to summon us to heaven, to welcome us into its innermost recesses, to show us Truth itself, to train us in right conduct, to plant within us seeds of virtue, to enrich us with the treasures of His grace, and to make us children of God and heirs of eternal life.
        
        Each year, as the Church recalls this mystery, she urges us to renew the memory of the great love God has shown us. This holy season teaches us that Christ's coming was not only for the benefit of his contemporaries: His power has still to be communicated to us all. We shall share His power, if, through holy faith and the Sacraments, we willingly accept the greace Christ earned for us, and live by that grace and in obedience to Christ.
        
        The Church asks us to understand that Christ, Whom came once in the flesh, is prepared to come again. When we remove all obstacles to his presence, He will come: at any hour and moment to dwell spiritually in our hearts, bringing with Him the riches of His grace. In her concern for our salvation, our loving Mother the Church uses this holy season to teach us through hymns, canticles, and other forms of expression, of voice or ritual, used by the Holy Spirit. She shows us how grateful we should be for so great a blessing, and how it gain its benefit: our hearts should be as much prepared for the coming of Christ as if He were still to come into this world. The same lesson is given for our imitation by the words and example of the holy men of the Old Testament.

      verse: Ephesians 1:3-10
      text: >
        Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places: just as He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him in love. He destined us for adoption as His children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace that He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His Blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace that He lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight, He has made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure that He set forth in Christ, as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in Him: things in heaven and things on earth.

      verse: Philippians 3:20-21
      text: >
        Our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the Body of His glory, by the power that also enables Him to make all things subject to Himself.
