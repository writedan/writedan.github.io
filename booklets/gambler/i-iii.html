			<h1><a href="index.html">Reform of the Roman Liturgy</a></h1>
			<h2>Its Background and Problems</h2>
			<h3><i>Ritus Romanus</i> versus <i>Ritus Modernus</i></h3>
      <p>
				In an article entitled "Four Hundred Years of the Tridentine Mass?", which has appeared in several religious reviews, Professor Rennings tries to present the new Missal, that is to say the <i>ritus modernus</i>, as a product of the natural and legitimate development of the liturgy of the West. According to him, there had been no "Mass of Saint Pius V" except during a period of thirty-four years, because from 1604 onwards the popes introduced modifications into the Missal of 1570. It was therefore entirely in accord with the process of development that [Saint] Paul VI, in his turn, reformed the <i>Missale Romanum</i> so that, says Rennings, the faithful "might the better perceive the unimaginable grandeur of the gift which, in the Eucharist, the Savior has bestowed on His Church."
			</p>
			<p>
				In his article, Rennings has picked on a traditionalist weakness: the expression "Tridentine Mass", for, at least at the conclusion of the Council of Trent, there was no creation of a new Mass order: and the "Missal of Saint Pius V" is nothing else but the Missal of the Roman Curia, which had seen the light in Rome centuries earlier, and which had been introduced by the Franciscans into many Western countries.<footnote>1</footnote> The changes made at the time by Saint Pius V were so minimal they can be noticed only by a specialist.

						<li>The Missal was completed by the Franciscans in the 13th century, and started to be commonly used by the Roman Curia under Pope Clement V, and was therefore known under the title <i>Missale secundum consuetudinem Romanae Curiae</i>.
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				One of Rennings' ruses is to make no clear distinction between the Order of the Mass and the Propers of Masses for different days and feasts. The popes, until [Saint] Paul VI, made no change in the Order of the Mass properly so-called, whereas, especially after the Council of Trent, they introduced new propers for new feasts. That no more suppressed the "Tridentine Mass" than, for example, additions to the civil law would cause it to lapse.
			</p>
			<p>
				We should therefore speak of the "Roman Rite" in contrast with the "Modern Rite." The Roman Rite, in important parts, goes back at least to the fourth century, more exactly to the time of Pope Damasus I. By the time of Gelasius, the Canon of the Mass had attained the form it has kept until now, apart from some modifications made under Saint Gregory. Since the fifth century, the only thing on which the popes have unceasingly insisted is that the Roman Canon must be adopted: their argument being that it originated with the Apostle Peter. But concerning the other parts of the Order, and the choice of Propers for Masses, they respected the customs of local churches.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until Saint Gregory, there was no official Missal containing propers for every feast of the year. The <i>Liber sacramentorum</i> published by Saint Gregory at the beginning of his pontificate was intended only for the Roman "Station Churches": in other words, for the pontifical liturgy. Saint Gregory did not intend to impose the Missal on all the West. That it dad later become the basis of the curial Missal or of the "Roman Missal" of Saint Pius V was due to a series of factors we cannot address here.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Middle Ages nearly every church, or at least every diocese, had its own special Missal unless it had voluntarily adopted the Missal of the Roman Curia. No pope intervened in this matter. The parts which, more than any other, were subject to variation, were those parts of the Order of the Mass said in a low voice by the celebrant (the prayers at the foot of the altar, the offertory &mdash; also called the Minor Canon &mdash; and the prayers before Communion): in other words, the priest's "private prayers." On the other hand, the sung texts were almost everywhere the same within the Latin Church. Only some of the readings and prayers differed from locality to locality.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was at this stage of development that the defense against Protestantism brought about the Council of Trent. It entrusted the Pope with the publication of an amended Missal uniform for all. What exactly did Saint Pius V do? As I have already said, he took the Missal already in use in Rome and in many other places and he improved it, especially by reducing the number of feasts of saints. Did he make this Missal obligatory for the whole Church? No, he even respected local traditions only two hundred years old. Such a tradition was sufficient to free a diocese from the obligation of using the "Roman Missal." The fact that, even so, the majority of dioceses very quickly adopted the new Missal is due to other causes. But Rome exercised no pressure &mdash; and that in an age during which, unlike today, there was no talk either of pluralism or of tolerance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first pope to actually alter the traditional Missal was Pius XII when he introduced the new Holy Week liturgy. It would have been possible to move to Holy Saturday Mass to night-time without modifying the rite. [Saint] John XXIII was next with his new arrangement of the rubrics. Even then, however, the Order of the Mass remained intact: but the door was now open for a radical rearrangement of the Roman liturgy. We have all lived through it, and we now contemplate at our feet the ruins, not of the Tridentine Mass, but of the ancient Roman Rite which had developed and grown to maturity during that long period. It was not perfect &mdash; this may be admitted. But small amendments would have been enough to adapt it to the present day. We will discuss this later in greater detail.
