			<h1><a href="index.html">Reform of the Roman Liturgy</a></h1>
			<h2>Its Background and Problems</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				It is generally accepted that, in one way or another, a liturgical reform, particularly an enrichment of the Roman rite, had become necessary because, since the Council of Trent, it had become ossified into a form of rubricism. There is also a consensus that the <i>Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy</i> of the Second Vatican Council corresponded in many respects to the legitimate pastoral requirements of our time. But no such consensus exists when we look at the reforms that were actually introduced, particularly the new liturgical books composed by a group of experts after the conclusion of the Council.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some have rejected the new books as artificial constructions reflecting all too clearly the spirit of the new theology and taking insufficient account of tradition. These people maintain that, on the whole, the reform of the liturgy has gone too far. On the other hand there are those who complain that the restrictive framework of rubricist thinking has yet to be breached, and that elements that have not proved their value, or even appear to be questionable, have become permanently embedded in the new liturgical books.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ideas we find reflected in the Council's <i>Constitution</i> are those of the liturgical movement of the twenties and thirties, particularly those of individuals like Romano Guardini and Pius Parsch &mdash; the former an inspired thinker exploring the innermost element of worship; the latter closer to the treasures of the <i>Missale Romanum</i> and the Divine Office. Yet, we cannot really say that either of the two was a scholar of liturgical history, and we can say this become neither truly understood the liturgy of the Eastern Church.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following World War I, when liturgical movements started to blossom, the study of the liturgy was still very much in its beginnings. At the universities, professorships in this field were rare. Liturgy was primarily understood as the study of rubrics: and as such, a component of general pastoral studies. Those few researchers who devoted themsevles to the study of liturgical history &mdash; the Benedictines G. Morin, C. Mohlberg, and A. Dold, to name but a few &mdash; did not, as a rule, hold professorships, and their influence was therefore limited. And at the grassroots level of pastoral care, the results of their research could not be expected to find much response anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has only be within the last ten years or so <footnote>1</footnote> that the study of liturgy has gradually been able to accomplish what it had neglected to do in the past. Today, we conduct systematic research into the origins of liturgical worship, not least because of a growing interest in the rich treasures to be found in the liturgy of the Eastern churches. We also have a better understanding of the importance of Christian acheology and its contributions to the study of liturgical history.

					It was at this time of hopeful beginnings that the Council assigned the task of reforming the Mass to liturgical experts. There can be no question that liturgical studies as an academic discipline was still in its early stages of development, and that it was simply overwhelmed by the assignment: and we must also understand that it was in no position to come up with definitive findings in many of its areas of study. In his book, <i>Missarum Sollemnia</i>, J. A. Jungmann could only provide a summary of initial, tentative, and partial study results: and such insights as there were, were insufficient as a basis for a fundamental change of liturgical norms.
			</p>
			<p>
				An even greater challenge was presented to the clergy and faithful when the liturgical reforms were actually introduced. Because tradition and local customs had always shaped liturgical worship, there simply had been no time to prepare for this type of change. Participation by the faithful in the formal liturgy had been generally limited: relatively few among them actually folloewed the Mass in their own missals. Instead, piety among the faithful was expressed in non-liturgical forms of worship, and very popular forms at that. It is in this context we have to understand and appreciate the person of Pius PArsch and what he did. In his time, he truly opened up new horizons to many people, teaching them to join the priest at the altar in the prayers and the Sacrifice.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, man has a tendency to go from one extreme to the other. If, in the past, the emphasis had been on the clergy performing the ritual of liturgical worship and administering the sacraments, now too much emphasis is being given to the congregation actively participating in the liturgy and doing away with many of the essential elements of the liturgical cult and ceremony. Because so many of these elements have been eliminated and are now in a state of common neglect, they are fading away rapidly. Also, we are now experiencing &mdash; and this applies especially to worship in larger group settings &mdash; a diminishing sense of solemnity. Solemnity is an integral part of the liturgical ceremony. But we are now breathing the thin air of Calvinistic sterility.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our time it is not uncommon to have a pastor despise the traditional forms of liturgical worship outright, spurning them as outdated. After all, priests seem to say, nobody wants to look as if he missed the boat. And yet, many of the faithful cling to the traditional forms: and the forms themsevles live on because of the fundamental piety contained within them. Our zealous reformers fail to recognize the obvious connection between Catholic teaching and piety. For many among the faithful, changes in the traditional liturgy also mean a change of the faith itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those in positions of power in the Church hierarchy did not listen to the voices counseling caution, voices which again and again urged that the traditional <i>Missale Romanum</i> should not be abolished, and that the new liturgy should only be allowed on a limited basis and only <i>ad experimentum</i>. Today, we are witnessing the sad spectacle of so many bishops accepting, without comment, almost any new liturgical experiment, while, when the opportunity arises, severely punishing a priest who, either for pratical purposes or as a matter of personal conscience, prefers to offer the traditional Mass.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nobody objects to the Church leadership adapting liturgical forms to the realities of our time, if this is really necessary. But it has to be done with discretion and great care: and in any case, without a break with Tradition. Even the <i>Constitution of the Sacred Liturgy</i> cautions us on this point, when in Article 23 it reads, "there must be no innovations unless the good of the Church genuinely and certainly requires them."
			</p>
			<p>
				With the introduction of the new Mass and liturgical texts, and even more so because of the aforementioned practice of the hierarchy to acquiesce in giving almost complete license for the redesigning of the liturgy, the break with Church tradition is now complete. At the same time, there is no convincing evidence to show the the change in the liturgy has brought about substantial improvement in the pastoral care of the faithful. Rather, what we are witnessing today is a large-scale decline in religious life (for a number of reasons). We we can say categorically is that the hopes that had been tied to liturgical reform have not been realized.
