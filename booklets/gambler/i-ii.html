			<h1><a href="index.html">Reform of the Roman Liturgy</a></h1>
			<h2>Its Background and Problems</h2>
			<h3>The Debacle of Modern Liturgy</h3>
      <p>
        As we have already observed, the liturgical reform welcomed with so much idealism and hope by many priests and lay people alike has turned out to be a liturgical destruction of startling proportions &mdash; a debacle worsening with each passing year. Instead of the hoped-for renewal of the Church and of Catholic life, we are now witnessing a dismantling of the traditional values and piety on which our faith rests. Instead of a fruitful renewal of the liturgy, what we see is a destruction of the forms of the Mass which had developed organically during the course of many centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Added to this state of affairs is the shocking assimilation of Protestant ideas brought into the Church under the guise of the misunderstood term <i>ecumenism</i> with a resulting growing estrangement from the ancient Churches of the East, that is, a turning away from the common tradition that has been shared by the East and West up to this point is our history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among those who played a key role in bringing about liturgical reform, more and more have come to realize that they are simply unable to control the very spirit they unleashed.
      </p>
			<p>
				The question we need to ask is: "What are the root causes of this liturgical debacle?" Any reasonable person understands that these causes cannot be traced to the Second Vatican Council alone. The <i>Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy</i> of 4 December 1963 was but an interim step in a process set in motion long ago, and for many different reasons. In the following pages we will endeavor to identify and define these root causes, one by one: but our discussion will necessarily be limited to basic facts.
			</p>
			<p>
				In contrast to the liturgies of the Eastern Church, which continued their development well into the Middle Ages, but remained fixed thereafter, the Roman liturgy, in its simple, even plain forms, which originated in early Christianity, has remained almost unchanged for centuries. There is no question that the Roman liturgy is the oldest Christian rite. Over time, a number of popes have undertaken revisions. In an early period, Pope Damasus I did so: and later, so did Pope-Saint Gregory the Great, among others.
			</p>
			<p>
				In his time, Saint Gregory, amking use of older liturgical texts, created a new <i>Sacramentary for the Liturgical Year.</i><footnote>1</footnote> He also regulated the sacred chant used by the Church, an accomplishment that later caused it to be called Gregorian Chant, although the melodies we know under that name were most likely written a hundred years after his death.<footnote>2</footnote>
				<footnotes>
					<ol>
						<li>See Gamber, K. "Approaches to the Original Gregorianum. Discussion of Primary Issues and an Attempt at Reconstructing the <i>Sacramentum</i> of Gregory the Great in A.D. 592", 1965.</li>
						<li>See Jammers, E. "Gregorian Chant and the Byzantine Empire", 1961.
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Damasian-Gregorian liturgy remained in use throughout the Roman Catholic Church until the liturgical reform in our time. Thus, it is inaccurate to claim that it was the Missal of Pope-Saint Pius V that has been discontinued. Unlike the appaling changes we are currently witnessing, the changes made in the Roman Missal over a peroid of almost fourteen hundred years did not involve the rite itself. Rather, they were changes concerned with only the addition and enrichment of new feast days, Mass formulas, and certain prayers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of political developments in the eighth century, which resulted in a closer liason between the King of the Franks and the Pope, the liturgy of Saint Gregory, which had been designed specifically for use in the city of Rome, became the standard of liturgical worship in many other parts of the Western World. The Gallican rite, then in common use, was suppressed. Only in Spain, where the Moors still held power, and in some areas of Ital (Milan and Acqui) and in the Duchy of Benevento, did this autonomous rite continue in use for some time. In fact, the Milanese rite <span class="v">the Ambrosian rite as it is called &mdash; D.W.</span> is in use in Milan today.
			</p>
			<p>
				The adoption by the Franks of the liturgy designed for use in Rome was the source of steadily recurring problems: the "foreign" rite was grafted onto existing local liturgical traditions of many cities and villages.<footnote>1</footnote> The process was never entirely successful &mdash; and therein lies a great tragedy. It is also one of the root causes of the debacle of today's liturgy.
				<footnotes>
					<ol>
						<li>See Th. Klauser, "Interactions between the Liturgies of the Roman and Fraconian Churchs from the Eighth to the Eleventh Century", 1933.
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				A second, important root cause is to be found in the alienation between the Roman Church in the West and the Eastern Churches, an alienation that began in the eighth and ninth centuries and led ultimately to the formal break between Rome and Byzantium in 1054. This break, which was not primarily the result of dogmatic differences, was serious in part because it led to the gradual disintegration of a very important element of worship in our Church &mdash; that of the early Christian concept of the liturgical <i>cultus</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to this concept, the liturgy is primarily a sacred act before God, which means, in the words of Saint Gregory, that:
				<div class="section">
					at the hour of Sacrifice, in response to the priest's acclamation, the heavens open up: the choirs of Angels are witnessing this Mystery: what is above and what is below unite: heaven and earth are united, matters visible and invisible become united. <span class="v"><i>Dialogues</i> IV, 60</span>
				</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				The concept of this <i>cosmic liturgy</i>, which continues to exist in the Eastern Church, is founded on a precisely ordered, solemn conduct of liturgical worship. The concept ruled out any of the forms of minimalism, which, beginning in the Middle Ages, evolved in the West &mdash; forms of worship designed to celebrate the holy mysteries only to the degree absolutely necessary for validity. Thus, in the Western Church, the rites were no more than "carried out", rarely "celebrated."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Eastern Church, however, the liturgy has always remained a dramatic mystery in which drama and reality were uniquely joined.<footnote>1</footnote> In this context, we can quote the comment made by Hugo Ball, the German playwright, who is also quite knowledgeable about the Greek Church: "For a Catholic, there really is no drama. Each morning, Holy Mass is the event that simply occupied him and holds him prisoner."<footnote>2</footnote>
				<footnotes>
					<ol>
						<li>See J. Tyciak, "Liturgy as a Source of Eastern Piety", 1927; O. Casel, "The Celebration of the Sacrifice in the Eastern Church as the Incident of the Mystery Occuring", 1939.</li>
						<li>See E. Hennings-Ball, "Huge Ball's Way to God", 1931.</li>
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				With the break between the Eastern and Western Churches, the important "drama" component of liturgical worship has been largely lost. In his widely read book, <i>About the Spirit of the Liturgy</i>, Romano Guardini also drew attention to the concept of liturgy as drama. Today, not much remains of these ideas, certainly not in liturgical worship: the cold breath of realism now pervades our worship.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the third root cause for the debacle of today's modern liturgy, we must look at the phenomenon of individual peity, which originated in the Gothic period. During that period, the people's active participation in the cult of liturgical worship &mdash; when heaven and earth united and divine grace flowed into us &mdash; ceased to be the central theme. Instead, it was the personal, the individual relationship to God and His grace, developed in private prayer, that predominated.
			</p>
			<p>
				More and more, the actual performance of the Church's liturgical rites became the responsibility of the clergy. The faithful were present and remained silent observers following the ceremonies while praying and contemplating. Special, non-liturgical "devotional services" were introduced to the faithful: they made use of the vernacular, and were meant to reflect <i>religio moderna</i>: the new ideal of piety.
			</p>
			<p>
				The consequence of this development was that the gap between liturgical cult and popular piety grew ever wider. The people were enthralled with all the non-liturgical devotions, which quickly expanded to include many different processions, like the Corpus Christi day procession, which traces its origin to this time. Also, pilgrimages grew in popularity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given this development, nobody should be surprised that what we have here is a clear indication of what one might call the first liturgical movement &mdash; occuring during the late Middle Ages. The movement appears to have started at the onset of the Age of Humanism, and presumably was founded on the novel concept of Man's individual nature. The Latin texts of the Mass and Divine Office, and particularly the Church hymns, were now translated with enthusiasm into the vernacular. For example, there is a <i>Missale vulgare</i>, a Missal for the laity, published as early as 1400 in Thuringia, which, in addition to the scriptural readings, includes translated parts of the prayers and responsorial chants of the Roman Missal.<footnote>1</footnote> Similar books were to follow.<footnote>2</footnote>

						<li>See K. Gamber, "<i>Missale vulgare</i>: A German Missal for the Common People from the Middle Ages", 1942.</li>
						<li>See Th. Bolher, "German Missal of 1529", 1964.</li>
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				During the same period, we also bote a first blossoming of canticles in German. New, popular songs were written in the vernacular: they could be sung during the intervals of the Latin chants of the Mass, or they could follow them. On Christmas Day, for example, it was common to sing three times, "Praise to you, Jesus Christ..." after the conclusion of the sequence <i>Grates nonc omnes</i>; or to sing Christmas songs following each verse of the <i>Gloria</i>.<footnote>1</footnote> Also at that time, many church songs for the faithful were written to be sung during pilgrimages and devotional services.
				<footnotes>
					<ol>
						<li>See K. Gamber, "The Christmas Gloria of Erfurt: On the History on Religious Songs in Liturgy", 1941.
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				It was Luther who recognized and understood the significance of these liturgical developments: he adopted them and then built on them. Yet, the German canticle was not his invention: nor did he, incidentally, even perceive the need to present the scriptural readings of the Mass to the faithful in their own language.
			</p>
			<p>
				As positive as these developments may have been at the time, we find in them yet another root cause for the debacle of today's modern liturgy. The popular church song, often of dubious value from a dogmatic and from an artistic point of view, particularly the songs flowing from pietism, tended to submerge the "classical" Latin chants of the Mass more and more, a process which, in the end, caused these chants to be given up almost entirely &mdash; a development that we are witnessing today.
			</p>
			<p>
				The period of a first <i>liturgical movement</i> in the late Middle Ages, and of the radical reforms started by Luther and other reformers, was followed by a period of reaction when the Council of Trent established rigorous ruels governing liturgical worship: in particular, the rule prohibiting the use of the vernacular.
			</p>
			<p>
				At that time, the Council Fathers demanded that liturgical books were to be newly published and that their use would be mandatory. This was accomplished by the publication of the <i>Missale Romanum</i> of Pope-Saint Pius V in 1570. A special Church office, the Congregation of Holy Rites, was established to ensure that the strictly prescribed rubrics were indeed being followed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reform intended by Saint Pius V did not create anything new. It was simply a comprehensive review of the Missal, editing out some additions and changes that, over time, had found their way into the text. Even so, older, unique rites, if they dated back at least two hundred years, were left untouched &mdash; demonstrating a spirit of amazing tolerance at that time in history.
			</p>
			<p>
				As necessary as the reform may have been at that time, in a larger sense it also meant that liturgical forms, as they had developed up to that point, had now been made permanent, making further, organic development impossible. Thus, sooner or later, the stage was set for radical change. Before it came to that, however, the Church entered a period of invigoration: the Baroque period, the final period in the Western world when Catholicism existed as a unified culture.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is easy to understand today's level of antipathy against anything associated with ceremonial liturgy, if we see it as a reaction to the liturgy of the Baroque period. Then, the churches were profusely decorated with statutes of saints and with ornamentation, and the altars were embellished with superstructures extending straight to the ceiling. Today, in contrast, austerity and realism are held to be the standard for the design of churches and altars: and even to display a cross now has become barely acceptable. If, in times past, the Mass was celebrated accompanied by orchestral music, before the Blessed Sacrament exposed to view, in the glow of countless candles and wafting incense, today, following the dictim, "Get rid of all signs of triumphalism," the celebrant stands before a bare altar made of stone, which often has an uncanny resemblance to a barrow, saying his prayers and addressing the people through a microphone.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most people in our time simply cannot relate to the liturgical forms of the Baroque. Yet, this circumstance should not prompt us to simply eliminate an essential part of the liturgy: that or worshipping God. To wroship &mdash; the gathering together for solemn service &mdash; is an obligation of man that can never change because man, by his nature, is a social animal: he was created a social being. That is why the solemn liturgical rite before God is found not only in Christianity, but also in the liturgy of the Temple of Jerusalem &mdash; a liturgy that continued to be observed by the Apostles (see Acts 2:46). Liturgical worship was a cultural phenomenon in the differnt civilizations of antiquity, and it existed even in primitive societies.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the Baroque period, the people, although they were able to partake in the celebration of the Mass in their hearts and mind, could not be active participants in the formal liturgy. Thus, new forms of popular piety emerged, for example, the Forty-Hour Devotion during the Easter Vigil, or the many devotions to Mary. They were deeply rooted in religious practice.<footnote>1</footnote>

						<li>See L. A. Veit and L. Lenhart, "The Church and Popular Piety During the Baroque Period", 1956.</li>
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				The new forms of piety, together with the formal liturgical worship attracting the faithful with its solemnity and ceremonial splendor, were the pillars on which the Counter-Reformation's newly restored Catholicism rested. Yet, we cannot ignore a great shortcoming of Baroque liturgy: the absence of deeper dogmatic meaning, which also affected the homilies preached in those days. The central mysteries of faith faded into the background, while peripheral truths moved to center stage.<footnote>1</footnote>

			</p>
			<p>
				Onto the flowering that life in the Church enjoyed during the Baroque period fell the frost of the eighteenth century and the Age of Enlightenment. People were dissatisfied with traditional liturgical forms because of a commonly held view that they did not adequately address the real problems of the day: there was a prevailing sense of being superior to the Baroque forms of popular peity. A particularly troubling aspet of this first dismantling of the traditional liturgy was that the state had embraced the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment (Josephism), and that many bishops readily joined the club.
			</p>
			<p>
				In many places, many traditional forms of worship were abolished, at times with the state using brutal force, and going against the will of the people. For example, in the Rhineland, the century-old tradition of the Latin Choral Mass being sung by the people was prohibited, and in its stead, the so-called German High Mass was introduced, often by force.<footnote>1</footnote> Unfortunately, after that experience, traditional liturgical forms were never brought back.
				<footnotes>
					<ol>
						<li>See W. Beamker, "The Catholic German Church Hymn", 1891: "The following episode illustrates the bitter hatred that erupted among the people as a result of the reforms. In 1787, on the Feast Day of Saint John, a great disturbance occured in the church. The new hymnal was being introduced to replace the Latin choral singing, which heretofore had been the accepted norm. During the High Mass, when the school children present were to have responded to the <i>Gloria in excelsis Deo</i> intoned by the celebrant, with a German song, the people started to hiss, and the choir responded with unusual force and vigor <i>Et in terra pax hominibus</i>. As the disturbance grew in intensity, the Elector dispatched two companies of infantry, artillery, and two squads of Hussars. Thirty ringleaders were sentenced to hard labor, and some among them were never to see their fatherland again."
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				During the Age of Enlightenment, the purpose of worship was seen primarily as that of instilling moral behavior in the people &mdash; which helps explain why Latin as the language of liturgy was rejected. The State told the Church to function as the extension of its own temporal authority &mdash; the ill-starred joining of "Throne and Altar" &mdash; by making the people into obedient subjects of the State. That meant theat the priest in the pulpit now had to exercise functions that had nothing to do with his office as a priest: for example, he had to explain and admonish people to obey civil laws and police ordinances.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was no lack of liturgical experiementation then, especially when it came to the administration of the sacraments.<footnote>1</footnote> Yet, these reforms did not survive very long. They are, however, distrubingly similar to today's experiments, and tey too, were very much concerned with man and his (social) problems. Thus, Vitus Anton Winter, one of the reformers of the Age of Enlightenment, demanded that all prayers be removed "which place man's hope in God and thus do not sufficiently encourage man's self-reliance." He also declared that, in his view, all prayers making us of oriental-biblical language should be done away with.<footnote>2</footnote> The newly developed texts were thus imbued with a moralistic tone evident in all writings of that time.
				<footnotes>
					<ol>
						<li>See, <i>inter alia</i> Vitus Anton Winter, "Catholic Ritual", 1830.</li>
						<li>See A. Vierbach, "The Views of Vitus Anton Winter on Liturgy," 1929.</li>
					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				We can conclude with certainity: the preeminent root cause of today's liturgical distress is to be found in the Age of Enlightenment. Many of the ideas of that period did not come to maturity until recently, when we are living through a new period of Enlightenment.
			</p>
			<p>
				A reaction to the cold reason brought by the Enlightenment was the Restoration period of the nineteenth century with its Neo-Romanticism and its Neo-Gothic art movement. Typically, the Neo-Romantics saw the spiritual ideas of the Middle Ages as the greatest model to follow and attempted to graft a new cutting from them onto the devastated old tree of liturgy.
			</p>
			<p>
				At that time, the Benedictine monastery of Solesmes in France and the priories of the Beuron congregation in Germany came into being. Within their walls, the traditional Latin liturgy and Gregorian chant in its original form were lovingly cultivated: and in these new monastic centers we can also find the beginnings of the liturgical movement of the 1920s. Initially, only small groups of intellectuals and some students were part of this. The Church's Latin remained alive in this movement.<footnote>1</footnote>

					</ol>
				</footnotes>
			</p>
			<p>
				Different from this movement were the efforts of Pius Parsch during the 1930s to create a liturgy for the people. Characteristic of his approach was an over-emphasis on the faithful's active participation in liturgical worship, together with speculation, mostly errorneous, about the form of worship among the early Christians and the design and furnishing of their sanctuary. The beginnings of the vernacular in the Roman liturgy can be traced to Pius PArsch, although during the initial stages the vernacular was used only in conjunction with the Latin of the celebrant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pius Parsch's ideas about the forms of liturgical worship that was pastorally effective, and also more directly involving the people, became part of the <i>Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy</i>, together with many of his errors, as, for example, his assertion that the celebration of Mass <i>versus populum</i> was historically justified. We will discuss this later in greater detail.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is no surprise that today's pastors who have no training in the strict norms of liturgy, did not stop with the <i>Liturgy of the People</i> as conceived by Pius Parsch, but developed what in their view were fresh ideas about a <i>contemporary</i> form of worship &mdash; ideas which often do not conform to traditional Catholic teaching. The Council Fathers, when publishing the <i>Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy</i> simply did not expect to see the avalanche they started, crushing under it all traditional forms of liturgical worship, even the new liturgy they themselves created.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given these developments, the message of the Pastoral Letter of the Austrian Bishops, dated 8 February 1965 sounds rather optimistic:
				<div class="section">
					It is not going to be easy for many among our priestly brothers, but they will soon be able to see for themsevles that nothing has been taken away (through this change), rather, that they have received a new gift. In order to achieve that noble goal, i.e. the spiritual renewal of our parishes, we are sure that all pastors will strive to celebrate the liturgy as beautifully as possible.
				</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				The fact in addition, all forms of extra-liturgical piety and religious tradition have also been abolished, makes it hard to access the extent of the damage done to the pastoral care of the faithful. We will have to wait and see what the consequences of this wholesale dismantling are going to be in twenty or thirty years, that is, among today's generation, which, unlike the older generation, will no longer be able to live on the memory of what remainds as the <i>quintessence</i> of our faith. Even the few positive results that have come out of the liturgical reform, which clearly include a greater involvement of the faithful in the liturgy, cannot possibly outweight the damage that is has done
