					<p>
						Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood. Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards. For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad. From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil. Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies. And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste. Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha. <br/>

And then they will see the son of Man coming upon a cloud with great power and majesty. but when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is at hand. And He spoke to them a parable. Behold the fig tree, and all the trees. When they now put forth their buds, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near. Amen I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all things have been accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. <br/>

					<h2>Homily</h2>
					<span class="v">From the sermons of Saint Leo the Great.</span>
					<p>
						Our Saviour Himself instructed His disciples concerning the times and seasons of the coming of the Kingdom of God and the end of the world, and He hath given the same teaching to the Church by the mouth of His Apostles. In connection with this subject then, Our Lord biddeth us beware lest we let our hearts grow heavy through excess of meat and drink, and worldly thoughts. Dearly beloved brethren, we know how that this warning applieth particularly to us. We know that that day is coming, and though for a season we know not the very hour, yet this we know, that it is near. <br/>
						Let every man then make himself ready against the coming of the Lord, so that He may not find him making his belly his god, or the world his chief care. Dearly beloved brethren, it is a matter of every day experience that fulness of drink dulleth the keenness of the mind, and that excess of eating unnerveth the strength of the will. The very stomach protesteth that gluttony doth harm to the bodily health, unless temperance get the better of desire, and the thought of the indigestion afterward check the indulgence of the moment. <br/>
						The body without the soul hath no desires; its sensibility cometh from the same source as its movements. And it is the duty of a man with a reasonable soul to deny something to his lower nature and to keep back the outer man from things unseemly. Then will his soul, free from fleshly cravings, sit often at leisure in the palace of the mind, dwelling on the wisdom of God. There, when the roar and rattle of earthly cares are stilled, will she feed on holy thoughts and entertain herself with the expectation of the everlasting joy.
					</p>
					<span class="v">From the sermons of Saint Gregory the Great.</span>
					<p>
						Our Lord and Saviour wisheth to find us ready at His second coming. Therefore He telleth us what will be the evils of the world as it groweth old, that He may wean our hearts from worldly affections. Here we read what great convulsions will go before the end, that, if we will not fear God in our prosperity, we may at least be scourged into fearing His judgment when it is at hand. <br/>
						Immediately before the passage which hath just been read from the Gospel, are found the following words of our Lord, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places, and pestilences and famines. Then, after a few more verses, cometh today's Gospel. There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring. Now some of these things are come to pass already, and we fear the others are not far off. <br/>
						In these our days we see nation rise against nation, and their distress over all the earth, more than we read in books hath ever come to pass of old time. Ye know also how often we hear of earthquakes overwhelming countless cities in other parts of the world. As for pestilences, we suffer from them ourselves, with hardly any intermission. As yet we do not see signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; but the changes of seasons and climates warn us that we may look for these also before long.

					<h2>Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed</h2>
					<p>
						I believe in one God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and of all things, visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God: born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, very God from very God: begotten, not made, of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. For us men and for all savation, He came down from heaven. <br/>
						<span class="v">(kneel)</span> And was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary: and was made man. <br/>
						He was crucified for us, suffered under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. And on the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father. He shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead, and His kingdom shall have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son: who, together with the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified: who spoke by the Prophets. I believe the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the foregiveness of sins. I expect the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

							<span class="v">V.</span> The Lord be with you. <br/>

							<span class="v">V.</span> Lift up your hearts. <br/>

						</p>
						<span class="v">Common Preface of the Holy Trinity:</span>
						<p>
							It is truly right and just, right and for our salvation, that we should at all times and in all palces give thanks unto Thee, O holy Lord, Father almighty, everlasting God: who together with Thy only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit are one God, one Lord: not in the oneness of a single Person, but in the Trinity of one substance. For what we believe by Thy revelation of Thy glory, the same do we beleive of Thy Son, as the same of the Holy Spirit, without differance or separation. So that in confessing the true and everlasting Godhead, distinction in person, unity in essence, and equality in majesty may be adored. Which the angels and Archangels, the Cherubim and Seraphim do praise: who cease not daily to cry out with one voice saying: <br/>
							"Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest."

						<h3>Canon</h3>
						<p>
							We therefore humbly pray and beg of Thee, most merciful Father, through Jesus Christ our Lord Thy Son, that Thou would accept and bless these gifts, these presents, these holy unspotted Sacrifices, which we offer Thee for Thy holy Catholic Church, to grant her peace and to preserve, unite, and govern her throughout the world, together with Thy servants <span class="v">N.</span> our Pope and <span class="v">N.</span> our bishop, and all believers of the catholic and apostolic faith.
						</p>
						<p>
							Be mindful, O Lord, of Thy servants and handmaidens <span class="v">N.</span> and <span class="v">N.</span> and of all here present, whose faith and devotion are known to Thee, for whom we offer up to Thee this sacrifice of praise for themselves, their families and friends, for the redemption of their souls, for the health and salvation they hope for, and who now pay their vows unto Thee, the everlasting, living, and true God.
						</p>
						<p>
							In union with and honoring the memory, especially of the glorious and ever-Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, as with blessed Joseph her spouse, and of the holy Apostles and Martyrs Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, John, Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon, and Jude, Linus, Cletus, Clement, Sixtus, Cornelius, Cyprian, Lawrence, Chrysogonus, John and Paul, Cosmas and Damian, and of all Thy Saints, we beg of Thee, through their merits and prayers grant that we may in all things be defended by the help of Thy protection. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
						</p>
						<p>
							We therefore beg of Thee, O Lord, to graciously accept this offering of our service and to dispose our days in Thy peace, preserve us from eternal damnation, and number us among Thy Elect. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
						</p>
						<p>
							Be pleased, O God, in all respects to bless, approve, ratify, make worthy and acceptable this offering: that it may become for us the Body and Blood of Thy most beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Who, the day before He suffered, took bread into His holy and venerable hands, and with His eyes lifted up towards heaven unto Thee, O God, His almighty Father, giving thanks to Thee, He blessed it, broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying: "Take and eat ye all of this, <span class="small">for this is My Body</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							In like manner, after supper was finished, taking also this excellent chalice into His holy and venerable hands, He blessed it and gave it to His disciples, saying: "Take and drink ye all of this, <span class="small">for this is the chalice of My Blood of the new and eternal covenant, the mystery of faith: which shall be shed for you and for many unto the foregiveness of sins.</span> As often as ye do these things, ye shall do them in remembrance of Me.

							Therefore, O Lord, we Thy servants, calling to mind the blessed Passion of the same Christ, our Lord, Thy Son, and also His Resurrection from the dead and His glorious Ascension into heaven, offer unto Thy most excellent Majesty of Thy own gifts bestowed upon us: a pure Host, a holy Host, an unspotted Host, the holy Bread of eternal life and the Chalice of everlasting salvation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Upon which look with a serene countenance, and accept them, as Thou were graciously pleased to accept the gifts of Thy just servant Abel, and the sacrifice of our patriarch Abraham, and that which Thy high priest Melchizedek offered to Thee: a holy Sacrifice and an unspotted Victim.
						</p>
						<p>
							We most humbly beg of Thee, almighty God, to command these offerings to be borne by the hands of Thy holy Angels to Thy altar on high, in the sight of Thy divine Majestty, that as many as shall partake of the most holy Body and Blood of Thy Son at this altar may be filled with every heavenly grace and blessing. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
						</p>
						<p>
							Remember also, O Lord, Thy servants and handmaidens <span class="v">N.</span> and <span class="v">N.</span> who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace. To these, O Lord, and to all that rest in Christ, grant, we beg of Thee, a place of refreshment, light, and peace. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
						</p>
						<p>
							To us also, Thy sinful servants, confiding in the multitude of Thy mercies, grant some part and fellowship with Thy holy Apostles and Martyrs John, Stephen, Matthias, Barnabas, Igantius, Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicitas, Perpetua, Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia, and with all Thy Saints, into whose company we beg Thee to admit us, not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offenses. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
						</p>
						<p>
							By whom, O Lord, Thou ever creates, sanctifies, brings to life, blesses, and gives unto us all good things. By Him and with Him and in Him is to Thee, God the Father almighty, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all honor and glory for all ages of ages. Amen.

					<p>
						Deliver us, we beg of Thee, O Lord, from all evils past, present, and to come: and by the intercession of the blessed and glorious ever-Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and of the holy Apostles Peter, Paul, and Andrew, and of all the Saints, mercifully grant peace in our days, that through the assistance of Thy mercy we may be always free from sin and secure from all disquiet.
