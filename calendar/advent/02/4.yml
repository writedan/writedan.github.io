        On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
        "A strong city is ours.
          Victory will be set: walls and ramparts.
        Open the gates
          and let a righteous nation enter,
            keeping faith.
        A steadfast nature Thou guards in peace
          for in Thee it trusts.
        Trust in the Lord forever,
          for in God the Lord is an everlasting Rock.
        for He has brought low the dwellers on high:
          the lofty city,
        brought down, brought it down to the earth,
          leveled it with dust.
        The foot tramples it,
          the feet of the needy,
            the poor man's footsteps."

        Jesus spoke unto the crowds: "Come to Me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you: for I am gentle and humble in heart, and ye will find rest for your souls. for My yoke is easy, and My burden is light."

        Commentary on the Psalms
        On Psalm CIX, Chapters I, II, and III
        Saint Augustine of Hippo, Doctor and Bishop

        God established a time for His promises and a time for their fulfillment. The time for promises was in the time of the prophets: until John the Baptist: from John unto the end is the time of fulfillment.
        
        God, Who is faithful, put Himself in our debt, not by receiving anything but by promising so much. A promise was not sufficient for Him: He chose to commit Himself in writing as well, as it were making a contract of His promises. He wanted us to be able to see the way in which His promises were redeemed when He began to discharge them. and so the time of the prohpets was, as we have often said, the foretelling of the promises. He promised eternal salvation, everlasting happiness with the Angels, an immortal inheritance, endless glory, the joyful vision of His face, His holy dwelling in heaven, and after resurrection from the dead no further fear of dying. This is as it were His final promise: the goal of all our striving. When we reach it, we shall ask for nothing more. but as to the way in which we are to arrive at our final goal, He has revealed this also, by promise and prophecy. He has promised men divinity, mortal immortality, sinners justificaiton, and the poor a rising to glory.
        
        But brethren, because God's promises seem impossible to me: equality with the Angels in exchange for mortality, corruption, poverty, weakness, dust and ashes: God not only made a written contract with men, to win their belief, but also established a mediator of His good faith, not a prince or Angel, but His only Son. He wanted, through His Son, to show us and give us the way He would lead us to the goal He has promised. It was not enough for God to make His Son our guide to the way: He made Him the way itself, that thou might travel with Him as leader, and by Him as the way.
        
        Therefore, the only Son of God was to come among men, to take the nature of men, and in this nature to be born as a man. He was to die, to rise again, to ascend into heaven, to sit at the right hand of the Father, and to fulfill His promises among the nations, and after that to come again, to exact now what He had asked for before, to separate those deserving His anger from those deserving His mercy, to execute His threats against the wicked, and to reward the just as He had promised. All this had therefore to be prophesied, foretold, and impressed upon us as an event in the future, in order that we might wait for it in faith, not find it in a sudden and dreadful reality.

        Do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, Who will bring light to things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.
