      verse: Isaiah 24:19-25:5
      text: |
        Shattered, the earth is shattered,
          all broken pieces is the earth:
            toppled, the earth is toppled.
        Reeling, the earth reels like a drunkard
          and rocks back and forth like a hut.
        And its crime lies heavy upon it:
          it has fallen and no longer shall rise.
        And it shall happen on that day,
          the Lord shall punish the heavenly hosts on high
            and the kings of the nations on the earth.
        They shall be rounded up as prisoners in a pit
          and locked up in a dungeon:
            and after many days shall be punished.
        And the moon shall be shamed
          and the sun disgraced,
        for the Lord of Armies has become king on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
          and before His elders is His glory.
          
        Lord, Thou are my God:
          I shall exalt Thee, acclaim Thy Name.
        For Thou has performed wondrous counsel,
          steadfast faithfulness from times long past.
        For Thou turned a town into rubble,
          a fortified city to ruins,
        the arrogants' citadel, from a town,
          it will never be built again.
        Therefore a fierce people does Thee honor,
          a city of cruel nations reveres Thee.
        For Thy people are a stronghold for the poor,
          a stronghold for the needy when in straits,
        a shelter from the downpour, a shade from the heat.
          For the spirit of the cruel is like a downpour on walls,
            like heat in the desert.
        The arrogants' uproar Thou subdued,
          the heat, with the shade of a clord.
            The chant of the cruel ones He answered.

      verse: Matthew 18:12-14
      text: >
        Jesus spoke unto His disciples: "What do ye think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it: truly I tell you: and rejoices over it more than the ninety-nine that never went astray. So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost."

      verse: |
        Lumen Gentium
        Chapter XLVIII
        Second Vatican Council
      text: >
        The Church, to which we all are called in Christ Jesus and in which we acquire holiness through the graces of God, will reach its perfection only in the glory of heaven, when the time comes for the renewal of all things, and the whole world, which is intimately bound up with man and reaches its perfection through him, will, along with the human race, be perfectly restored in Christ.
        
        Lifted up above the earth, Christ drew all things to Himself. Rising from the dead, He sent His life-giving Spirit upon His disciples, and through the Spirit established His mystical Body, which is the Church, as the universal sacrament of salvation. Seated at the right hand of the Father, He works unceasingly in the world, to draw men into the Church and through it to join them more closely to Himself, nourishing them with His own Body and Blood, and so making them share in His life of glory.
        
        The promised renewal that we look for as already begun in Christ. It is continued in the mission of the Holy Spirit. Through the Spirit it goes on developing in the Church: there we are taught by faith about the meaning also of our life on earth as we bring to fulfillment, with hope in the blessings that are to come, the work that has been entrusted to us in the world by the Father, and so work out our salvation.
        
        The end of the ages is already with us. The renewal of the world has been established, and cannot be revoked. In our era it is in a true sense anticipated: the Church on earth is already sealed by genuine, if imperfect, holiness. Yet, until a new heaven and a new earth are built as the dwelling place of justice, the pilgrim Church, in its sacraments and institutions belonging to this world of time, bears the likeness of this passing world. It lives in the midst of a creation still groaning and in travail as it waits for the sons of God to be revealed in glory.

      verse: Genesis 49:10
      text: |
        The scepter shall not pass from Judah,
          nor the the royal mace from his grasp,
        until he comes that is to be sent
          and to him the submission of peoples.

      verse: Isaiah 38:10-14, 17-20
      text: |
        I thought, in the prime of my days I will pass away:
        to the gates of Sheol I am consigned
          for the rest of my years.
        I thought: I will not see God in the land of the living,
          I will no more look on man, with the dwellers of the world.
        My abode is pulled up and taken from me
          like the tent of a shepherd.
        I have rolled up my life like a weaver,
          from the loom He cuts me away,
            from day to night Thou finishes me.
        Like a swallow or swift I chirp,
          I moan like a dove.
        My eyes are worn out looking high.
          O King, I am oppressed: be my surety.
        
        Why, instead of peace, it was bitter for me, bitter:
          but Thou held back my life
            from destruction's pits.
        for Thou flung behind Thy back all my offenses.
            For Sheol will not acclaim Thee,
          nor will death praise Thee.
        Those who go down to the Pit
          cannot hope for Thy faithfulness.
        The living, the living, he acclaims Thee,
          like me on this day.
        Fathers will make known to sons
          Thy faithfulness.
        The Lord is here to rescue us,
          and let us play music
        all the days of our life
          in the house of the Lord.

      verse: 1 Corinthians 1:7-8

        I give thanks to God always for thee because of the grace that God has given thee in our Christ, Jesus, for in every way thou has been enriched in Him: in speech and knowledge of every kind: just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among thee: so that thou are not lacking in any spiritual greace as thou waits for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He wil lalso strengthen thee to the end, so that thou may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful: by Him thou were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
