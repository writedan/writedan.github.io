      "I Myself will heard My flock, and I Myself will bed them down," said the King the Lord. "The lost one will I seek out, and the strayed one will I bring back, and the one with the broken limb will I bind up, and the weak one will I strengthen, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will herd the flock in justice. I am about to judge between sheep and goats."
