      verse: Isaiah 16:1-5, 17:4-8
      text: |
        Send a lamb
          to the ruler of the land
        from the wilderness crag
          to the Mount of the Daughter of Zion.
        And like a wandering bird
          sent out from the nest,
        the daughters of Moab shall be
          at the fords of the Arnon.
        Take counsel,
          weigh judgment.
        Make thy shade like the night
          at high noon.
        Shelter those driven out,
          do not expose the displaced.
        Those driven from Moab
          shall sojourn among thee.
        Be a shelter for them
          against the marauder.
        For oppression is over,
          marauding has ended,
            the tramplers are gone from the land.
        And a throne is set firm in mercy
          and on it shall sit in truth
            in the tent of David
        one who judges and seeks justice
          and is swift to do right.
        
        And it shall happen on that day,
          Jacob's glory shall turn gaunt,
            and the fat of his flesh become lean.
        
        And as he was like one who gathers standing grain,
          by armsfuls gleaning,
        he shall be like one gathering ears of grain
          in the Valley of Ghosts,
        only gleanings will be left to him, as when an olive tree is beaten,
          two or three berries at the top of the bough,
            four or five on the branches of the fruit tree:
        says the Lord God of Israel.
        
        On that day man shall turn to his Maker and his eyes shall look to Israel's Savior. And he shall not turn to the altars, his handiwork that his fingers made, and he shall not look to the cultic poles and the incense altars.

      verse: Matthew 7:21, 24-27
      text: >
        Jesus spoke unto His disciples: "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of My Father in heaven."
        
        Then He gave them a parable: "Everyone then who hears these words of Mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock. The rains fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on the house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine but does not act on them will be like a fool who built his house on sand. The rains fell, the floods came, and the windows blew and beat against the house and it fell: and great was its fall."

        Commentary on the Diatessaron
        Saint Ephrem the Syrian, Doctor and Deacon
      text: >
        To prevent His disciples from asking the time of His coming, Christ said: "About that hour no one knows, neither the Angels nor the Son. It is not for you to know times or moments." He has kept these things hidden so that we may keep watch, each of us thinking that He will come in our own day. If He had revealed the time of His coming, His coming would have lost its savour: it would no longer be an object of yearning for the nations and the age in which it will be revealed. He promised that He would come but did not say when He would come, and so all generations and ages await Him eagerly.
        
        Though the Lord has established the signs of His coming, the time of their fulfillment has not been plainly revealed. These signs have come and gone with the multiplicity of change: more than that, they are still present. His final coming is like His first. As holy men and prophets waited for Him, thinking that He would reveal Himself in their own day, so today each of the faithful longs to welcome Him in his own day, because Christ has not made plain the day of His coming.
        
        He has not made it plain for this reason especially, that no one may think that He Whose power and dominion rule all numbers and times is ruled by fate and time. He described the signs of His coming: how could what He has Himself decided be hidden from Him? Therefore, He used these words to increase respect for the signs of His coming, so that from that day forward all generations and ages might think that He would come again in their own day.
        
        Keep watch: while the body is asleep nature takes control of us, and what is done is not day by our will but by force, by the impulse of nature. When deep listlessness takes possession of the soul, for example, faint-heartedness or melancholy, the enemy overpowers it and makes it do what it does not will. The force of nature, the enemy of the soul, is in control.
        
        When the Lord commanded us to be vigilant, He meant vigilance in both parts of man: in the body, against the tendency to sleep, in the soul, against lethargy and timidity. As Scripture says: "We up, ye just," and "I have risen, and am still with you," and again, "Do not lose heart. Therefore, having this ministry, we do not lost heart."

      verse: Jeremiah 33:15

        In those days and at that time I will make a righteous shoot flourish for David, and He shall do justice and righteousness in the land.

      verse: Revelation 11:17-18, 12:10-12
      text: |
        We give Thee thanks, Lord God the Almighty,
          Who are and Who were,
        for Thou has taken Thy great power
          and begun to reign.
        The nations raged,
          but Thy wrath has come,
            and the time for judging the dead,
        for rewarding Thy servants, the prophets
          and Saints and all who fear Thy Name,
            both small and great,
        and for destroying those who destroy the earth.

      verse: James 5:7-9
      text: >
        Be patient, beloved, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth, being patient with it until it receives the early and late rains. Ye must also be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. Beloved, do not grumble against one another, so that ye may not be judged. Behold: the Judge is standing at the doors.
